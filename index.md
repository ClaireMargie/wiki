To be effective and successful in realms of biomedical research involving large scale biomedical datasets, researchers themselves are increasingly being required to become more adept data stewards as well as better integrate data management tools into their every day research processes. The Biomedical Data Science Wiki project aims to create a curated collection of Fred Hutch oriented documentation regarding the generation of large scale molecular data from human specimens, the bioinformatics and analytics required to interpret those data, and the high performance computing infrastructure available for managing both data storage and computing tasks.   

## Overview of Wiki Content
As the Wiki content is intended to serve as an 'on ramp' for researchers at the Fred Hutch, the material is oriented toward helping researchers to get up to speed on current best practices, links to on-campus resources that are relevant to a specific domain,  as well as useful links to other external content about specific topics.  The three domains of biomedical research this Wiki is intended to serve include: **Data Generation**, **Bioinformatics** and **High Performance Computing**.  

### [Data Generation](/generation/gen_index/)
This domain contains information that ranges from important IRB and human subjects privacy matters that are important for clinical and behavioral data analysis, human specimen banking, large scale molecular profiling projects, through data management tools and resources useful for collection of clinical, specimen and laboratory covariates, as well as the types and modes of large scale molecular data generation commonly undertaken.  

### [Bioinformatics](/bioinformatics/inf_index/)
This domain contains information about the bioinformatic and analytic processes required to transform data generated in the context of biomedical research into interpretable, actionable, and/or shareable scientific findings.  Topics range from background on various common computing languages used in the domain, to research topic oriented process information and tool descriptions, to worked examples of bioinformatic analyses using Fred Hutch based infrastructure.  

### [Scientific Computing](/computing/comp_index/)
This domain houses researcher-oriented documentation for high performance computing and data management tools supported by Fred Hutch Center IT as provided by the Scientific Computing group (SciComp).  Topics include get started guides for the various computing and software tools supported by IT, guidance for data infrastructure best practices, and advanced computing worked examples and guides on a variety of topics.  

## Contributing
This project involves the creation of a **curated Wiki** and as such relies upon the Fred Hutch research community itself to improve, review, expand and evolve over time.  Because the content of this Wiki spans a wide range of research realms, we need and welcome contributions from a similarly wide range of researchers.  For more information on how to contribute see our [Contributing page on CenterNet](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/sciwiki/contributing.html) or our [GitHub guide.](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki/blob/master/README.md)


## Wiki Writer-Editor Program
The Writer-Editor program is intended to engage current Fred Hutch based postdocs, staff scientists, and research specialists as writer-editor contributors in an ongoing manner in order to ensure that the resource continues to evolve and grow. To learn more about the program, contact Amy Paguirigan at `apaguiri`, or [see more information here.](https://fredhutch.github.io/wiki/outreach/)
