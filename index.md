To be effective and successful in realms of biomedical research involving large scale biomedical datasets, researchers themselves are increasingly being required to become more adept data stewards as well as better integrate data management tools into their every day research processes. The Biomedical Data Science Wiki project aims to create a curated collection of Fred Hutch oriented documentation regarding the generation of large scale molecular data from human specimens, the bioinformatics and analytics required to interpret those data, and the high performance computing infrastructure available for managing both data storage and computing tasks.  This overlap between biomedical research and the data it generates constitutes what is essentially biomedical data science.  

The ongoing engagement, contribution and curation of the content in the Biomedical Data Science Wiki by the Fred Hutch researcher community itself is intended to serve two purposes:
- create an evolving source of documentation that grows and changes along with the particular interests and research tools available to Fred Hutch researchers over time, and,
- tailor and unifies content that bridges the divide between how research processes are performed in general and how those processes are performed at the Fred Hutch specifically.



## Overview of Wiki Content
As the Wiki content is intended to serve as an 'on ramp' for researchers at the Fred Hutch, the material is oriented toward helping researchers to get up to speed on current best practices, links to on-campus resources that are relevant to a specific domain,  as well as useful links to other external content about specific topics.  The three domains of biomedical research this Wiki is intended to serve include: **Data Generation**, **Bioinformatics** and **High Performance Computing**.  

### [Data Generation](/generation/gen_index/)
This domain contains information that ranges from important IRB and human subjects privacy matters that are important for clinical and behavioral data analysis, human specimen banking, large scale molecular profiling projects, through data management tools and resources useful for collection of clinical, specimen and laboratory covariates, as well as the types and modes of large scale molecular data generation commonly undertaken.  

### [Bioinformatics](/bioinformatics/inf_index/)
This domain contains information about the bioinformatic and analytic processes required to transform data generated in the context of biomedical research into interpretable, actionable, and/or shareable scientific findings.  Topics range from background on various common computing languages used in the domain, to research topic oriented process information and tool descriptions, to worked examples of bioinformatic analyses using Fred Hutch based infrastructure.  

### [Scientific Computing](/computing/comp_index/)
This domain houses researcher-oriented documentation for high performance computing and data management tools supported by Fred Hutch Center IT as provided by the Scientific Computing group (SciComp).  Topics include get started guides for the various computing and software tools supported by IT, guidance for data infrastructure best practices, and advanced computing worked examples and guides on a variety of topics.  

## Contributing
This project involves the creation of a **curated Wiki** and as such relies upon the Fred Hutch research community itself to improve, review, expand and evolve over time.  Because the content of this Wiki spans a wide range of research realms, we need and welcome contributions from a similarly wide range of researchers.  These contributions may be as novice reviewers for a topic outside of their particular domain of expertise or as expert contributors for those topics of most interest to them.  No contribution is too little, or too large, and this section describes the various modes and types of contributions each researcher on the Fred Hutch campus can make to this effort.  

The strength of the Wiki lies in its collaborative and unified approach. To facilitate the curation of content seen in this site, we have employed a GitHub repository to which any Fred Hutch-based researcher can be a part of and contribute to.  The instructions for how to get started via GitHub are below as well as additional information about the ways to communicate with and participate in the Wiki Contributor team in other ways as well.  Once users have a GitHub account set up, every content page in our site has an "Edit this Page" icon at the bottom of it, and users can suggest any edits directly and they'll be reviewed by the community.

### Current Contributors List
[Go here](https://fredhutch.github.io/wiki/contributors/) to see our current list of contributors.  

### Communication and Events
To get involved there are many ways to find us:
- The Wiki team has weekly, "office hours" style Wiki Working meetings that you can stop by and get some assistance to get set up, or just chime in with your edits, typo-finds and suggestions when time permits!  The current schedule can be found on the [FHBig Google calendar,](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r?cid=Z2QzMGRsaWZyaTRmdTdoMTA0Y3VxZGowZGdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) just look for "Wiki Working Meeting" in the event name, or please email `sciwiki` for more information.  

- Join the **FHBig** Slack workspace via [this link, and use your fredhutch.org email to join.](https://join.slack.com/t/fhbig/shared_invite/enQtMzUyMDIxNzk3MDU3LWNjMDg3ZDVhNGZiNTBlODRmNWM5ZjczMzI1MGNmZTg4NGQ5ODgzMGNmMjcyNzMxMDc0YWFlN2VkNjI4NGZjNjg)  In this Slack workspace we have a #wikicontributors channel where you can chime in with edits, get updates about next meetings, goals and our next steps.  

- Follow along in our GitHub repository where we are curating this content [if you have gotten set up to use the Fred Hutch GitHub organization account, see below for instructions.](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki)

- Please email Amy Paguirigan (`apaguiri`) if you have comments about the Wiki documentation as it stands now, questions about getting set up with contributing (via GitHub or via an in-person meeting or Google document).  

### Types of Contributions
- Write new content on an existing or new topic.
- Be an expert or novice reviewer to one of our pull requests.
- File issues for suggested new site content.
- Take 30 minutes and find as many typo's and poor grammar as you can! #my-typo-branch
- Chime in on Slack about what you like or what you see is missing.  
- Meet with Amy Paguirigan or other Wiki team members to collaboratively curate content about your research domain even without using GitHub.  

### Wiki Writer-Editor Program
The Writer-Editor program is intended to engage current Fred Hutch based postdocs, staff scientists, and research specialists as writer-editor contributors in an ongoing manner in order to ensure that the resource continues to evolve and grow.  We aim to incorporate more information relevant to new and emerging projects or technologies in which Fred Hutch researchers are involved or use, and also provide a mechanism for feedback regarding what additional documentation is needed to support their research.  To learn more about the program, contact Amy Paguirigan at `apaguiri`, or [see more information here.](https://fredhutch.github.io/wiki/outreach/)

## Contributing Logistics
### Wiki Content Style Guide
Go to [this link](https://fredhutch.github.io/wiki/styleguide/) to see the current, and continually growing, style guide for content in this Wiki as decided upon by the Wiki Contributors group.  As the community decides upon certain styles, flags, and structures we will continually update this document to reflect the current Wiki Best Practices.  

### Contributing Directly Via GitHub
In order to access the GitHub repository to provide new content or edit existing content, Fred Hutch researchers need a GitHub user account (if you do not already have one, you can [obtain one here via GitHub.](https://github.com/join)).  Once a user has a GitHub user account, access to the Fred Hutch institution can be granted by IT (email Fred Hutch username `scicomp` and send your GitHub username to them to add you).  Once you have an account that is linked to Fred Hutch, you can find our detailed instructions for contributing [here.](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki/blob/master/README.md)
