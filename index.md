This site contains a curated collection of Fred Hutch oriented documentation regarding the generation of large scale molecular data (such as genomics, transcriptomics, etc.), bioinformatics and analytics required to interpret those data, and the high performance computing infrastructure available for managing both data storage and computing tasks.  Each domain has an overview page accessible via the top navigation bar that serves as an introduction the material covered in more detail by the individual topic pages.  


These materials are intended to serve as an 'on ramp' for researchers at the Fred Hutch to get up to speed on current best practices, links to on-campus resources that are relevant to a specific domain,  as well as useful links to other external content about specific topics.  This site serves as a starting place where the Fred Hutch community can document the information and resources common to many types of research happening at the Center and to communicate more effectively how to access and employ new or changing resources in an ongoing manner.  

## Overview of Content Planned
The site will include documentation in three general domains:  

### Data Generation
This section will contain information that ranges from important IRB and human subjects privacy matters that are important for large scale molecular profiling projects, through tools useful for collection of clinical, specimen and laboratory covariates, as well as the types and modes of large scale molecular data generation commonly undertaken.  

### Bioinformatics
Overview.
### Scientific Computing
Overview.

## Contributing
### How to contribute
The documentation provided by this site is a collective project in which researchers who are both experts in some of the research domains included and perhaps novices in others contribute to both spread the labor and improve the documentation.  To facilitate the curation of content seen in this site, we have employed a GitHub repository to which any Fred Hutch based researcher can be a part of and contribute to.  The instructions for how to get started via GitHub are below.  

The Wiki team has ongoing, weekly Wiki Working meetings that you can stop by and get some assistance to get set up, or just chime in with your edits, typo-finds and suggestions!  To get involved there are many ways to find us:

- Please email Amy Paguirigan (apaguiri) if you have comments about the Wiki documentation as it stands now, questions about getting set up with contributing (via GitHub or via an in-person meeting or Google document) or if you'd like to get current time/place information for the next Wiki Working meeting.  
- Join the **FHBig** Slack workspace via [this link, and use your fredhutch.org email to join.](https://join.slack.com/t/fhbig/shared_invite/enQtMzUyMDIxNzk3MDU3LWNjMDg3ZDVhNGZiNTBlODRmNWM5ZjczMzI1MGNmZTg4NGQ5ODgzMGNmMjcyNzMxMDc0YWFlN2VkNjI4NGZjNjg)  In this Slack workspace we have a #wikicontributors channel where you can chime in with edits, get updates about next meetings, goals and our next steps.  
- Follow along in our GitHub repository where we are curating this content [if you have gotten set up to use the Fred Hutch GitHub organization account, see below for instructions.](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki)

### Types of Contributions
- Write new content on an existing or new topic.
- Be an expert or novice reviewer to one of our pull requests.
- File issues for suggested new site content.
- Take 30 minutes and find as many typo's and poor grammar as you can! #my-typo-branch
- Chime in on Slack about what you like or what you see is missing.  
- Meet with Amy Paguirigan or other Wiki team members to collaboratively curate content about your research domain even without using GitHub.  


### Wiki Content Style Guide
Go to [this link](https://fredhutch.github.io/wiki/styleguide/) to see the current, and continually growing style guide for content in this Wiki.  As the community decides upon certain styles, flags, and structures we will continually update this document to reflect the current Wiki Best Practices.  

### Contributing Directly Via GitHub
In order to access the GitHub repository to provide new content or edit existing content, Fred Hutch researchers need a GitHub user account (if you do not already have one, you can [obtain one here via GitHub.](https://github.com/join)).  Once a user has a GitHub user account, access to the Fred Hutch institution and the FHBig GitHub team can be granted by IT (email Fred Hutch username scicomp and send your GitHub username to do this).  


We manage the content of this site via a set of markdown files that
  1. Create a branch off the master branch for your edits.  Consider naming the branch in such a way that indicates what domain the edits will primarily be in (such as "generation-typos" or "computing-newcontent").  
  2. Commit any edits or new material to only the markdown files in the "pages" directory.  
  3. Publish/push your branch to GitHub to save your work and let us know you're working on something.
  4. When done editing, create a pull request from your branch.  Suggest reviewers based on the content of the edits.
  5. Reviewers will sign off on edits by approving or providing comments on a pull request, ideally one "expert" and one "novice" based on field of expertise.  
  6. Once pull requests are merged, then any edits go live to the site [here.](https://fredhutch.github.io/wiki/)
