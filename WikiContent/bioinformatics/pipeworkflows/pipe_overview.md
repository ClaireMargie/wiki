# Overview of Pipelining and Workflows
When executing computational analyses it can be difficult to keep track of what
analyses have been run, with what parameters, and on what files. In order to keep
track of this information and make it easier to reproduce your results, people
often turn to computational tools for "pipelines" and "workflows." In this section
we address the relative merits of a range tools that are used for pipelines and workflows.
## Shell Scripting / Bash
## Serverless (since this isn't really a pipelining-specific topic but rather an HPC topic)
