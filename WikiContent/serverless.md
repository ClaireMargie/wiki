# Serverless Computing

Serverless computing doesn't mean there is no server, but users do not need to provision, scale, and manage any servers. The servers are usually handled by cloud providers. You can also run such application on premise. 

> Why serverless is mentioned here?
Nowdays, we hear IaaS (Infrastructure as a service), PaaS (Platform as a service) and SaaS (Software as a service). 
- IaaS: The responsibility of configure, administrate and management of resources is on the users
- PaaS: Users do not need to manage OS
- SaaS: Users only need to use the service.

Serverless falls into the category between PaaS and SaaS, another name for it is FaaS (Function as service).
