This would be the landing site for the first domain, for all things data generation
Large scale molecular data such as next generation sequencing or array based data is becoming ever more accessible and useful for translational research. However, while many of the fundamental aspects of biology that these tools assess are familiar, there are unique issues that arise when hundreds to thousands of data points are collected simultaneously that must be considered during the experimental design phase.  Not every question about every cohort or sample set can be answered using a given large molecular data set, and the sentiment to "sequence it and find out" can be an appealing, but ultimately risky (and costly) approach.  

## Large Scale Data and Hypothesis Development
"The data may not contain the answer. The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data." - John Tukey  

"If you torture the data, it will confess to anything" - Ronald Coase.

In this section we will provide some guidance for researchers looking to develop a hypothesis that will have reasonable statistical power and a feasible set of samples and execute a large scale data production from them.
