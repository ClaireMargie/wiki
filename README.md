## Contributing
This curated Wiki is just that, curated and a wiki, and as such relies upon the Fred Hutch research community itself to improve, expand and evolve over time.  Because the content of this Wiki spans a wide range of research realms, we need and welcome contributions from a similarly wide range of researchers whether as novice reviewers for a topic outside of their particular domain of expertise or as expert contributors for those topics of most interest to them.  No contribution is too little (or too large), and this section describes the various modes and types of contributions each researcher on the Fred Hutch campus can make to this effort.  

The strength of the Wiki lies in it's collaborative and unified approach. To facilitate the curation of content seen in this site, we have employed a GitHub repository to which any Fred Hutch based researcher can be a part of and contribute to.  The instructions for how to get started via GitHub are below as well as additional information about the ways to communicate with and participate in the Wiki Contributor team in other ways as well.

### Contributing Directly Via GitHub

We manage the content of this site via a set of markdown files that
  1. Create a branch off the master branch for your edits.  Consider naming the branch in such a way that indicates what domain the edits will primarily be in (such as "generation-typos" or "computing-newcontent").  
  2. Commit any edits or new material to only the markdown files in the "pages" directory.  
  3. Publish/push your branch to GitHub to save your work and let us know you're working on something.
  4. When done editing, create a pull request from your branch.  Suggest reviewers based on the content of the edits.
  5. Reviewers will sign off on edits by approving or providing comments on a pull request, ideally one "expert" and one "novice" based on field of expertise.  
  6. Once pull requests are merged, then any edits go live to the site [here.](https://fredhutch.github.io/wiki/)
