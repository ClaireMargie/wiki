Collective KnowledgeBase for Science


## Overview of Content Planned

Three Domains:
- Data Generation
- Bioinformatics
- Scientific Computing



The goal for each of the three main domains covered in this site would be to have multi-tiered content such that the following levels are represented:
1.  Landing page that serves to introduce the domain itself to a novice reader and orient them to the categories of content specific to the domain that will be covered in additional pages.
2.  A set of 3-5 categories of content related to the domain in which each category has enough detailed description of the preliminaries required for a person with intermediate experience can interpret the content and know which level 3 content they might be interested in.  
3.  Final level detailed documentation intended to be consumed by experts in the domain.
