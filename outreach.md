## Biomedical Data Science Wiki Writer/Editor Program

>Note:  Applications to be a wiki writer/editor are currently being accepted on a rolling basis.  Join us for this inaugural session and have the opportunity to influence how this project evolves!  Please contact Amy Paguirigan or Justin Burge for additional information.  

The [Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) aims to support ongoing biomedical research now and in the future and is the product of the Fred Hutch researcher community. The ongoing contribution and curation of the content in the Wiki by the Fred Hutch researcher community itself is intended to serve two purposes:

1. create an evolving source of documentation that grows and changes along with the particular interests and research tools available to Fred Hutch researchers over time, and
2. unify content that bridges the divide between how research processes are performed *in general* and how those processes are performed at the Fred Hutch *specifically*.

To fulfill these two purposes we have the Wiki Writer/Editor program which is intended to engage current Fred Hutch based postdocs, staff scientists and research specialists to create and edit content and help the [Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) achieves those goals. We aim to incorporate information about new and emerging technologies or projects in which Fred Hutch researchers are involved or use, and also provide a mechanism for feedback regarding what additional documentation is needed to support their research. The Wiki Writer-Editor program engages current staff from all of the Divisions for a three month timeframe to both write and edit content with a stipend provided for said work. 

### Do you have a desire to:

- Communicate with the research community and help improve the [Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) 
- Share and communicate out how to use a new tool or resource
- Document something you find yourself explaining multiple times to your co-workers( ex. best practices, getting started, how to, things to avoid, TL;DR)
- Get better at using GitHub
- Get technical writing experience
- Get paid *(Bonus of $500 is added to paycheck for 36 hours of wiki writing and editing spread over three months (equates to 12hrs per month or 3hrs per week depending on how you want to allocate your time over the three months)*

### Responsibilities for a Wiki Writer/Editor include:

- An initial one hour meeting for training on how to edit and manage contributions via GitHub (web OR desktop client training will be provided; previous experience with Github is not required).
- Participate remotely or locally in the one hour weekly “Data Science Wiki work meeting” on Thursdays from 10-11am PST
- Approximately 3 hours per week of writing documentation in your primary area of expertise and/or editing existing documents on the [Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) both in and outside of your primary area of expertise. This work is done remotely, anytime during the week at your convenience and contributions are submitted regularly via GitHub. Contributions are then reviewed and incorporated along with all other contributions at the weekly Data Science Wiki work meeting.
- Provide reviews of content for formatting, clarity and accuracy (when in your area of expertise) when other contributors submit pull requests.

### Possible areas of interest and content development for the [Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) include:

- Editing existing content on the [SciWiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) for accuracy, readability, and brevity
- Nextflow
- AWS
- ???

### Requirements:

- Participants in the Wiki Writer/Editor Program must be Fred Hutch employees (require their appointment to be via Fred Hutch)
- Have the ability to write clearly and concisely for a wide range of scientific audiences and levels of expertise.  
- Can self-direct and time manage to make your contributions have the most value as well as coordinate with your research.  
- Can work collaboratively and professionally with others who will both edit your writing and whose writing you will edit.  
- Have an interest in contributing to the Fred Hutch research community.
- Have an interest in learning more about biomedical research and resources here at Fred Hutch that you may not already be familiar with!

### Application Materials:

To apply to the Wiki Writer/Editor Program email the following application materials combined as a single pdf file to `sciwiki`:

- Name, Primary Division affiliation, Current Mentor/Lab(s), Current Position
- A brief (½ page max) summary of your current research focus and general domain of expertise (what you ALREADY know) along with your current data-oriented learning goals (what you WISH you knew).
- A sample of your writing - preference is for text intended for as general a scientific audience as possible, such as a recent abstract or other review article, and for text that as closely reflects your writing style as possible (without heavy editing by others)
- Your current CV (FYI:  a link to it or other full online profile can suffice, e.g., a complete LinkedIn profile or a personal website)

### To get involved there are many ways to find us:

- More information can be found at the [Biomedical Data Science Wiki]({{site.baseurl}}/outreach), the [Github README](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki/blob/master/README.md) and the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Join the **FHBig/Coop Communities** Slack workspace via [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/fhbig/shared_invite/enQtMzUyMDIxNzk3MDU3LWNjMDg3ZDVhNGZiNTBlODRmNWM5ZjczMzI1MGNmZTg4NGQ5ODgzMGNmMjcyNzMxMDc0YWFlN2VkNjI4NGZjNjg), and use your `fredhutch.org`, `uw.edu`, `scharp.org`, or `sagebase.org` email to join.  In this Slack workspace we have a `#wiki-contributors` channel where you can chime in with edits, get updates about next meetings, or converse with other contributors about next steps. 
- If you have your GitHub username linked to the Fred Hutch GitHub organization account then you can follow along in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki) where we are curating this content. If you have not done this yet, please see more about [using GitHub at Fred Hutch](/scicomputing/software_managecode/).
