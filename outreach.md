## Translational Genomics Pop Up Events
Starting in Fall of 2018 we will begin hosting Pop Up workshops!!!  You can find up to date events by going to [the FHBig Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2QzMGRsaWZyaTRmdTdoMTA0Y3VxZGowZGdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) and looking for those events labeled "Pop Up:...".  If you'd like to get on the roster, please email Amy Paguirigan (`apaguiri`) or go chat about it on [Slack.](https://fhbig.slack.com)  


## FH Biomedical Data Science Wiki Writer-Editor Program

The Biomedical Data Science Wiki aims to support ongoing biomedical research now and in the future. The ongoing contribution and curation of the content in the Wiki by the Fred Hutch researcher community itself is intended to serve two purposes:
- create an evolving source of documentation that grows and changes along with the particular interests and research tools available to Fred Hutch researchers over time, and
- tailors and unifies content that bridges the divide between how research processes are performed *in general* and how those processes are performed at the Fred Hutch *specifically.*


The Writer-Editor program is intended to engage current Fred Hutch based postdocs in order to ensure that the resource achieves those two goals.  We aim to incorporate more information relevant to new and emerging projects or technologies in which Fred Hutch postdocs are involved or use, and also provide a mechanism for feedback regarding what additional documentation is needed to support their research.  The postdoc Wiki Writer-Editor program engages current Fred Hutch postdocs from each of the Divisions for 3 month positions, a stipend is provided.  

### Requirements
The requirements for participation as a postdoc writer-editor include:
- An initial meeting for training in how to manage contributions and editing via GitHub (web OR desktop client training will be provided, no previous experience needed).  
- Participation in the weekly in-person meeting of larger Wiki Contributors group (1hr)
- ~3 hours per week of writing documentation in your primary area of expertise and/or editing existing documents both in and outside of your primary area of expertise.  This work is done remotely, anytime during the week, and contributions are submitted regularly via GitHub.  Contributions are then reviewed and incorporated along with all other contributions at the weekly Wiki Contributors meeting.  
- Other considerations:
  - Ability to write clearly and concisely for a wide range of scientific audiences and levels of expertise.  
  - Ability to self-direct and time manage to make your contributions have the most value as well as coordinate with your research.  
  - Ability to work collaboratively and professionally with others who will both edit your writing and whose writing you will edit.  

### Application Materials
These need to be combined into a single pdf file and emailed to Amy Paguirigan (`apaguiri`).
- Name, Primary Division affiliation, Current Mentor/Lab
- A brief (Â½ page max) summary of your current research focus, your current data-oriented learning needs (what you WISH you knew) and your primary domain of data experience (what you ALREADY know)
- A sample of your writing - preference is for text intended for as general a scientific audience as possible, such as an abstract or other review article, and for text that as closely reflects your writing style as possible (without heavy editing by others)
- Your current CV

### Selection process
When applications are received, applicants will be provided a short article to edit and return prior to selection.  We aim to select up to 3 postdocs per session, and ideally each cohort will have primary affiliations with different Fred Hutch Divisions.
