## [Overview of Compute Resources on Campus]({{ site.baseurl }}/bioinformatics/compute_resoverview/)
Researchers are more and more likely to need to analyze raw data sets using some sort of analysis process before they can be interpreted in the context of the scientific question. Raw data, whether from an array or sequencing for example, are not typically directly interpretable results, thus require some degree of processing. The nature of the processing depends on the data type, the platform with which the data were generated, and the biological question being asked of the data set. How this process is performed depends on the specific project, but support and resources for this process are available at the Fred Hutch for a variety of needs.  This section contains articles that describe a range of computing resource options available to Fred Hutch researchers, all the way from a single laptop to the Fred Hutch on-premise high performance computing cluster (gizmo) to various cloud-based options, as well as how to get started using each platform.


## [Github, Versioning and Sharing Code]({{ site.baseurl }}/bioinformatics/compute_github/)
While version control software has evolved over time, a new evolution that is happening more and more is the need for a wider group of researchers to actively use version control resources to manage their code and documentation of processes that are ongoing in their research. From the perspective of reproducibility, shareability and interoperability, the need for a sharing platform that integrates version control and collaboration is becoming more and more a critical part of a researcher’s toolkit. Thus, regardless of the degree to which code plays a direct role in a research project, more and more often at least a cursory understanding of what GitHub is and how it can be utilized in scientific research is important.

## [Docker]({{ site.baseurl }}/bioinformatics/compute_docker/)
At its core, Docker is a tool that lets you run code inside a totally fixed and reproducible computational environment. If you have used virtual machines, then you can think of a Docker container as being a lightweight, portable, intuitive system for building and running virtual machines. The major difference between a Docker container and virtual machine is that Docker doesn’t come with operating system, which makes it more lightweight and portable. However, Docker containers do require the Docker engine to run them, which is a client-side application.
