Bioinformatics refers to the computational analysis of raw biological
data, typically those generated within the context of a scientific experiment or
research project. One of the most rapidly expanding and heavily
used application of bioinformatics is genomic sequence analysis,
in which some form of high-throughput, large scale data collection instrument
(such as a genome sequencer or a DNA microarray) is used to collect
a large amount of information about such biological entities as
genes, organisms, transcripts, etc.  Large scale data generation approaches like this can be referred to as molecular profiling, and can be applied to a variety of biological and biomedical research contexts from model organism studies (e.g., yeast strains) to human specimens in the context of a clinical assay.
