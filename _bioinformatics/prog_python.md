Python is one of the many programming languages that can be used to execute
computational analyses, and it is used extensively within the bioinformatic
community. A very high-level comparison of Python to other commonly used
languages is that it's generally on the easier side for being able to learn
and understand, but it doesn't give you as much detailed control over the
details of computation compared to C. In other words, it's easier to use, 
but not quite as performant. One of the nice things about Python in recent
years has been that there is a large community of software developers contributing
highly efficient code as installable modules, which makes the entire codebase
more valuable for your average user. 

## Resources
There are some publicly accessible resources available to assist in getting started learning and using Python for scienctific research computing.  Note the **How-To's and Training** section in the sidebar for additional details and in-person training opportunities.
