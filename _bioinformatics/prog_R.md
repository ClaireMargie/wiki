## Current R Builds on Gizmo
SciComp maintains a current list of the various builds of R available on `gizmo` for use by researchers.  Each build has different packages installed and versions of R itself, thus identifying if an existing R build matches your needs is a first step to using R on `gizmo`.  If you do not see a build that meets your needs [here,](https://fredhutch.github.io/easybuild-life-sciences/R.html) then contact `scicomp` with the specific needs of your project.  



## R Packages and Extensions
There are a number of available resources built on R that are free and open source that can greatly expand the utility of R and RStudio for research purposes.  

### Bioconductor
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) is a public repository of R bioinformatics packages. Bioconductor packages are curated for intercompatibility and grouped into [workflows](http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.7/workflows/) (eg. CyTOF, ChIP-seq, eQTL, etc...). New Bioinformatic tools often result in a submission of the corresponding packages to Bioconductor.

### The Tidyverse
The [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a group of R packages that coordinate together and are commonly used for manipulating and  visualizing data in data science applications.  There are a number of useful packages for research based users that are part of the Tidyverse, and it's worth the time to learn about them and see how one might employ them to clean, analyze and convey data and results.  DataCamp has an online [Introduction to the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) that can be useful when first evaluating whether these packages might be useful.  

### Shiny
[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package bundled with RStudio that enables the creation of interactive applications powered by R code. These apps can be viewed on any computer running RStudio, or they can be hosted on a server. Scicomp provides instructions for hosting Shiny apps [here](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/compdemos/shiny/)
