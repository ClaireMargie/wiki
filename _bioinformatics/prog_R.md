## What is R?
R is a programming language and also a software development environment. It is widely used among statisticians and has strong capabilities for statistical modeling and data analysis. While R's core functions are fairly small, there is a robust community of user-contributed R 'packages' (eg. see "Bioconductor" below). You can [download](https://cran.r-project.org/) R for your computer, or run R on SciComp's computing clusters (see "Current R Builds on Gizmo").

## What is RStudio?
RStudio is a graphical frontend to R that also improves upon a basic R installation, providing syntax-highlighting and code-completion, static or dynamic reports (via RMarkdown documents), and easing the creation of R packages, among other functionalities. Like R itself, RStudio is free to [download and use](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)


## Current R Builds on Gizmo
SciComp maintains a current list of the various builds of R available on `gizmo` for use by researchers.  Each build has different packages installed and versions of R itself, thus identifying if an existing R build matches your needs is a first step to using R on `gizmo`.  If you do not see a build that meets your needs [here,](https://fredhutch.github.io/easybuild-life-sciences/R.html) then contact `scicomp` with the specific needs of your project.

## The Tidyverse


## Shiny
[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package bundled with RStudio that enables the creation of interactive applications powered by R code. These apps can be viewed on any computer running RStudio, or they can be hosted on a server. Scicomp provides instructions for hosting Shiny apps [here](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/compdemos/shiny/)
