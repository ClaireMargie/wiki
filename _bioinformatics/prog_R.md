## What is R?


## What is RStudio?



## Current R Builds on Gizmo
SciComp maintains a current list of the various builds of R available on `gizmo` for use by researchers.  Each build has different packages installed and versions of R itself, thus identifying if an existing R build matches your needs is a first step to using R on `gizmo`.  If you do not see a build that meets your needs [here,](https://fredhutch.github.io/easybuild-life-sciences/R.html) then contact `scicomp` with the specific needs of your project.
