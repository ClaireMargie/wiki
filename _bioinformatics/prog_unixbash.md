Unix is the foundation for both Linux and macOS, and is the operating system
that is most commonly used for developing and executing bioinformatic software
tools. In order to navigate a Unix-based operating system and execute commands,
it is extremely useful to use the command line interface, which is generally
referred to as BASH (Bourne-Again SHell). 

## Resources
