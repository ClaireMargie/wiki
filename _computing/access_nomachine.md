NoMachine NX is a remote desktop software for Linux servers that gives you full remote access to a graphical user interface from Windows or Mac clients. It is installed on the SciComp session Servers `lynx`, `sphinx` or `manx` which you use to access the `rhino` systems. To connect through the local Fred Hutch network or through a VPN connection please download and install the NoMachine Enterprise Client from [NoMachine's Site.](https://www.nomachine.com/download-enterprise#NoMachine-Enterprise-Client)  Windows users can also install an older version from "Software Center". 

Configuration is very quick and the process is described in this video.

One of the nicest features of NoMachine is that you can disconnect from the server's desktop environment and later resume the connection and continue right where you left off with all terminal windows in the same place. NoMachine from Windows or Mac is often a better choice than installing a Linux desktop.
