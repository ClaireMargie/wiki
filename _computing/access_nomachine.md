Terminator is a convenient terminal emulator that can have multiple terminals in a single window. After starting Terminator you can right click on the terminal window and either split it horizontally or vertically. This 1 min video shows you how it works:

You can use Terminator on your Linux desktop. Windows and Mac users will need a X11 software to use SciComp resources as graphical desktop. We recommend NX NoMachine to connect to one of the SciComp session Servers lynx, sphinx or manx. Please download the NoMachine Enterprise Client from

and install it. Windows users can also install an older version form "Software Center". Configuration is very quick:

One of the nicest features of NoMachine is that you can disconnect from your desktop and later resume the connection and continue right where you left off with all terminal windows in the same place.
