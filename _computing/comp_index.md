Center IT supports a wide array of resources made available to researchers.  Much of the basic computing information needed on an ongoing basis can be found via Centernet and the Center IT pages.  However, much of the scientific computing resource documentation beyond this material is provided in this section of the Wiki, and links to existing resources and documentation are provided when available.

## Access and Credentials

This section includes a variety of information about accessing computing resources at the Fred Hutch, including managing credentials for services when required.

- [Methods]({{ site.baseurl }}/computing/access_methods/)


## Data Storage

The Hutch, through Center IT and Scientific Computing, support a number of options for storing your data. The service you use to store your data will depend on the nature of the data and the anticipated use.

## Getting More Help

There are many resources available for getting help with your computing needs- from essential questions about which resources are appropriate for your data and for your work, to more abstract and esoteric questions about how to produce and analyze data.

### Scientific Computing

Scientific Computing (SciComp) supports most of the resources described above.  SciComp can thus both provide direct assistance or, where other expertise is required, connect you with other groups.

Scientific Computing hosts office hours where you can drop in to ask questions or work through problems.

SciComp can be contacted via an email to `scicomp`.

### COOP
