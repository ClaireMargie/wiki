There are Fred Hutch supported data storage systems that allow you to share data with people outside the Hutch, with or without a Hutch ID in order to facilitate data transfer and receipt in collaborations within or outside of the Fred Hutch.  

## Aspera

The Aspera is a storage appliance that runs a heavily tuned storage server and client that enables fast transfer of large data between this system and a host using the Aspera client (either command line or via a browser).  The primary method of operation is to upload the data to the server, then use the web interface to create an email with a link you would then send to those outside the Hutch network.

> NOTE: space is limited. Because of this, data stored here is deleted after a short period of time making the Aspera inappropriate for primary storage.  Always keep the primary source on one of the other options above (fast, economy, etc.)

Visit [the Aspera information page](https://aspera.fhcrc.org/index.html) for more details and information on using this storage service.

## OneDrive

Visit the [OneDrive CenterNet page](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/projects/ignite/onedrive.html) for more details and information on using this storage service.
