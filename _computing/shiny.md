## [R Shiny Application](https://shiny.rstudio.com)

## Version Control Tool required to deploy your R Shiny Application to Fred Hutch deployment

If you do not have a GitHub account, please [register one](https://github.com/join?source=header-home). 

#### [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)

#### [GitHub](www.github.com)

A good tutorial on how to use GitHub with command line can be found [here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fredhutch-docs/Introducing-Git-and-GitHub.pdf).

#### [Electron](https://electronjs.org/apps/github-desktop)




## Deployment Service from SciComp

1. Does your application codebase live on GitHub? If so, is it under FredHutch account? 
2. How do you want to name (DNS name) your application? So the it will look something like **<your_application_DNS_name>.fredhutch.org**
3. Is your application facing Fred Hutch internally or externally? 
4. Does your application require authorization (log in), that only your collaborators have access? 
5. Does your application contain PHI? Please remove PHI from your application.
6. Have you given access to <rmcdermo@fredhutch.org>

## [Optional] Testing locally

- Are you able to create a Dockerfile at the root of your application and run a docker container?
