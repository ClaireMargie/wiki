## [In-Person Training and Office Hours](http://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/computing/training_overview/)
SciComp provides in-person training via weekly office hours; this page contains the current times and locations.

## [Current Software](http://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/computing/software_overview/)
For software running on your Windows or Mac laptop or desktop, please contact your [Division IT support.](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/contact-us.html)  However, when running software on our Linux servers (including Ubuntu Desktops), we have a system of pre-compiled software packages that should be your first stop when using a new software package.  This links directly to the most updated software catalog for these servers.
