Overview of support for database storage of large, structured data.

## MyDB
_MyDB_ is a service supported by Scientific Computing (SciComp) that allows you to provision a dedicated database by logging into the [MyDB console](https://mydb.fredhutch.org/login) and choosing the kind of database you want to set up.  Four database types are available:
- Postgres,
- MariaDB,
- MongoDB, and
- Neo4j.

More detailed information about getting set up with _MyDB_ is included in the Database article in the sidebar.  There is currently no charge for this service.  MyDB should not be used for protected data.


## REDCap
Supported at Fred Hutch by CDS.
