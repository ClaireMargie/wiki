# Understanding Workflows

Text describing the concept of workflows

For more details, see [Background on Workflows](workflow_background.md).

# Getting Started

It'll take <10?> minutes to [run your first workflow](running/running_first_workflow.md). There is a small amount of setup required.


Once you've run your first workflow, take a look at the [Workflow Catalog](workflow_catalog.md) for a list of existing workflows you can run.

If you're ready to run a workflow, you need to decide [where to run your workflow](running/where_to_run.md), on [AWS](running/on_aws.md) or [on-premise (Rhino & Gizmo)](running/on_gizmo.md).

If you run into issues, take a look at the [Frequently Asked Questions](running/faq.md).
