## What is a Workflow?

It' a structured, predefined set of steps to achieve a desired result. 


## What's a Good Candidate for a Workflow?

Inputs -> Step(s) -> Output

If you have a series of steps (alignment, QC calculation, analysis, etc) that can be done with a single set of inputs, it can become a workflow.


## Benefits of Workflows

* Repeatable - 
* Flexible - Can be used with many different input configurations, not just one script.
* Fast & Scalable - faster performance
* Supported - logs, debugging, tracing
