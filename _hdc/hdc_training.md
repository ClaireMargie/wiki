title: Training and Documentation

Overview of training and documentation resources available through HDC.

FIXME: need to reconcile and deduplicate with info [here](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/reference_training/)

## Instructor-led training

- other SR courses (not developed/maintained by fh.io)
  - Ted Gooley clinical stats course
  - image analysis
  - Genomics Articulate resource (currently under development?)

>FIXME: No info regarding what instructor led courses will look like in the future?

## Self-directed learning

For those who aren't able to attend in-person courses we have a range of stand alone resources to help guide their self-directed learning. Due to the nature of these courses an instructor is not available to answer questions. Please bring questions to the relevant office hours or to the TBD NAMED FH SLACK

>FIXME: what will new slack be named
>FIXME: Link to slack?

- [Fredhutch.io](http://www.fredhutch.io/) is an initiative to facilitate education about and promote access to computational resources at Fred Hutch. Those interested in learning core computational skills like R and Python can work through this content at their own pace.
  - [Intro to Python](https://fredhutchio.github.io/python_intro/)
  - [Intermediate Python](https://fredhutchio.github.io/python_programming/)
  - [Intro to R](https://fredhutchio.github.io/r_intro/)

>FIXME: Fredhutchio web page indicates that these courses are taught in person. This will need to change.

- [Bioinformatics and Genomics Resource Library](hdc/bioinformatics_library) is a curated list of external resources related to bioinformatics and genomics including peer reviewed papers, blog posts, and video tutorials.

- [The Scientific Computing Resource Library]() includes tutorials of how to perform common computational tasks using software available at Fred Hutch. Below we've highlighted a few popular links, but be sure to check out the page to see all the tutorials available.
  - [How to Rhino](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/compdemos/howtoRhino/)
  - [R Tips and Tricks](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/compdemos/R_tips_tricks/)
  - [Accessing Economy Local Storage](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/compdemos/Economy-storage/)

- [Code templates and examples](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/software_examples/) have been developed for those who are interested in implementing methods from the Scientific Computing Resource Library on their own data following best practices for reproducibility. We provide code templates for setting up your own analyses, as well as addtional examples of executable code that can be tailored to suit your own needs.

>FIXME a lot of this is redundant. Will we remove the previous wiki pages and re link out? Or link to the existing wiki page with links?
