Fred Hutch offers a variety of educational resources on aspects of bioinformatics, analytics, and working with data. Here you can find the opportunties for training and help offered through Fred Hutch as well as access a resource library of external online educational content.

## Instructor-led training

We hope to offer instructor-led training and workshops in the near future.

Keep an eye out for:
- Journal clubs to bring together people with shared interests in a particular method or technology to discuss current, high-impact papers.
- Workshops that offer training specific to Fred Hutch infrastructure such as how to effectively use the Slurm cluster or access and use AWS.

>Instructor-led opportunties are in the planning stage and pending staff support.

## Self-directed learning

For those who aren't able to attend in-person courses we have a range of stand alone resources to help guide their self-directed learning. 

- Fredhutch.io is an initiative to facilitate education about and promote access to computational resources at Fred Hutch. Those interested in learning core computational skills like R and Python can work through this content at their own pace.
  - [Intro to Python](https://fredhutchio.github.io/python_intro/)
  - [Intermediate Python](https://fredhutchio.github.io/python_programming/)
  - [Intro to R](https://fredhutchio.github.io/r_intro/)

- [Bioinformatics and Genomics Resource Library](hdc/bioinformatics_library) is a curated list of external resources related to bioinformatics and genomics including peer reviewed papers, blog posts, and video tutorials.

- [The Scientific Computing Resource Library](compdemos/) includes tutorials of how to perform common computational tasks using software available at Fred Hutch. Below we've highlighted a few popular links, but be sure to check out the page to see all the tutorials available.
  - [How to Rhino](compdemos/howtoRhino/)
  - [R Tips and Tricks](compdemos/R_tips_tricks/)
  - [Accessing Economy Local Storage](compdemos/Economy-storage/)

- [Code templates and examples](scicomputing/software_examples/) have been developed for those who are interested in implementing methods from the Scientific Computing Resource Library on their own data following best practices for reproducibility. Code templates are provided for setting up your own analyses, as well as addtional examples of executable code that can be tailored to suit your own needs.

>Due to the nature of self-directed learning there is no instructor immediately available to answer questions or troubleshoot. Please bring questions to the relevant office hours (listed below) or to the [Coop Communities Slack](fhbig.slack.com).

## Office hours 

- __Hutch Data Core:__ Staff are available to assist researchers in getting started with bioinformatics and orienting staff to resources for improving their coding, including troubleshooting application of code to research questions.
  - Hosted Every Tuesday from 9:00 to noon, staffed by Lauren Wolfe

Staff are available to answer questions related to access and usage of Hutch resources for computational research.
  - Hosted every Wednesday from 10:00 to noon, staffed by Ben McGough
- __Scientific Computing - Cloud/Next Gen:__ In addition to general consulting (see above), Scientific Computing (SciComp) supports researchers interested in emerging technologies like next generation sequencing and cloud computing. Staff are available to answer questions about getting started building analytical pipelines in the cloud, and generally making computation more scalable and reproducible.
  - Hosted every Tuesday from 3:00 to 4:30, staffed by Dan Tenenbaum
- __Ethics and Compliance:__ Staff from the Center Information Technology (CIT) Compliance Office with expertise in information security are available to answer questions related to secure data management and resources at the Hutch for security compliance.
  - Hosted every Wednesday from 10:00 to noon, staffed by Susan Glick

>Office hours can also be found on the Centernet Calendar.  
>Due to COVID-19 all office hours are currently hosted through MS Teams.
