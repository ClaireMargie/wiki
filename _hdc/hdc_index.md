The Hutch Data Core is a Shared Resource at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
which works to support the needs of researchers who utilize large amounts of data in
their research. While the needs of researchers vary widely by technical domain, scientific
goals, and computational complexity, the Data Core works to provide support via:

- Instructor-led trainings & self-paced learning
- Project-oriented consultation (via the Bioinformatics Core)
- Data portals for automated analysis and visualization
- Curated bioinformatics workflows for common tasks in genomics, imaging, proteomics, etc.
