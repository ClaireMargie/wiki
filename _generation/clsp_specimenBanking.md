## STTR Supported LabMatrix for Specimen Banking
More to come about guidance for data management tools specifically tailored for prospective specimen banking, as well as transfer of existing data to facilitate ongoing research using retrospectively banked specimens.  

### Available Resources
  - [LabMatrix](http://www.biofortis.com/labmatrix): LabMatrix is a specimen tracking platform that can be used to capture clinical and laboratory covariates. One of its main strengths is the ability to capture lineage of specimen processing steps in a workflow (for example, multiple nucleic acid types could be extracted from the same tissue). Currently, the [STTR group](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/seattle-translational-tumor-research.html) is piloting a LabMatrix project at the Hutch.

## Fred Hutch Specimen Processing Shared Resources
Fred Hutch researchers have access to retrospectively banked specimens through Northwest Biotrust.  Additionally, the two previous shared resources called Specimen Processing and Research Cell Bank have merged and now the group is available to provide services such as receipt and processing of biospecimens with existing or researcher-defined protocols, nucleic acid extractions, DNA fingerprinting (e.g. for confirmation of cell line identities as required now by many funding agencies), to specimen storage resources.

## Impact of Specimen Processing and Handling on Downstream Data
More to come about the common types of specimen preservation, processing and handling approaches that are particularly impactful on what types of data are feasible and desirable to generate.
