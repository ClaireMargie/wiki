## Data Sharing Plan and the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy
For extramural investigators, genomic data sharing plans are to be submitted as part of an application for funding, in the Resource Sharing Plan section of the application.

*Elements of a Genomic Data Sharing Plan*
  1.	Data Type
  2.	Data Repository
  3.	Data Submission and Release Timeline
  4.	IRB Assurance of the Genomic Data Sharing Plan
  5.	Appropriate Uses of the Data
  6.	If necessary, Request for an Exception to Submission


## Using De-Identified Human Specimens for Genomics Research
For funding agencies like the NIH, the increased use of genomic data sets from human specimens outside of the context of the definition of human subjects research has resulted in some changes when submitting proposals for funding.   The NIH Questionnaire that can help you determine if the study you are envisioning would need to be categorized as Human Subjects Research, or exempt in some way can [be found here.](https://humansubjects.nih.gov/questionnaire) For those studies that propose to generate or use data generated from human specimens for which the investigator, nor anyone on the team can re-identify the specimens themselves, a new document is required explaining the situation and why it does not qualify as Human Subjects.

Use the information in the Questionnaire to describe why your particular study is not required to be subjected to Human Subjects based restrictions and reporting.  When (not if!) the proposal is funded, the investigator will not be required to address the Human Subjects reporting (such as Inclusion Reports and training), but WILL be required to address the need to share any genomic data sets used via public repositories as is consistent with the consents of the original tissue donors.  


## NIH Just-In-Time information
Upon the return of scientific review panel percentile rankings of an NIH proposal submitted to the NIH, if the percentile rank is in the range that is potentially fundable (typically an impact score of 30 or less), investigators will receive a request for more information called the Just-In-Time (JIT) Request.  It is to some degree, up to the investigator to decide, given the Institute to which they applied, their particular percentile ranking and the previous paylines of that particular Institute as to whether further action to respond to the JIT at that time is needed or perhaps it's best to wait. You can learn more about support for Fred Hutch investigators regarding their JIT requests [at this Centernet site,](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/osr/sponsored-projects/just-in-time/nih-just-in-time.html) as well as more general information about JIT from other organizations too such as the Department of Defense, as well as using the *Hutch Grants* system to manage the submission of information [at this Centernet site from the Office of Sponsored Projects.](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/osr/sponsored-projects/just-in-time.html)

### Institutional Certification for Human Genomic Data Sharing
For those NIH grants that specify that genomic data sets will be generated from human specimens, the requirement for submitting an institutional certification will be requested as part of the JIT.  The NIH currently (as of 7/12/2018) requests this assurance that investigators intend to submit any datasets generated to the appropriate public repository such as dbGaP.  In the JIT information the investigator will see this request:

The current policy behind this request seems to be an ever-changing set of guidelines that depending on the type of data generated as part of the study, the date upon which the human specimen was collected, and the details of the consent in place at that time all currently have implications for the process the investigator needs to address.  At the time of this writing, the NIH Office of Science Policy [provides this site describing Researchers and Institutional Certifications, though again, even the links in the JIT document from the NIH itself are already broken, so additional searching may be required.](https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/researchers-institutional-certifications/)  Please let us know by emailing `sciwiki` if you notice NIH policy changes.  


## Facilities and Resources Descriptions
Boilerplate text for proposals that require a description of what facilities, shared resources, instruments and services are available at the Fred Hutch can be obtained in a handful of places listed below.
