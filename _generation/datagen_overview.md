There are many forms of large scale data generated here at the Fred Hutch and each has it's unique set of considerations.  We have endeavored to begin curating data-type specific guidance from around the Fred Hutch in this section.

The Fred Hutch Genomics Shared Resource offers researchers, both at the Fred Hutch and externally, access to a wide range of genomics platforms in a fee for service context often accessible via [Hutchbase.](https://hutchbase.fhcrc.org/base2/)  Services that are available range from study planning, nucleic acid quality assessment, to sample or library preparation, to data generation and basic bioinformatics. This page provides an overview of the currently available platforms, the types of support available through Genomics, strengths and weaknesses of each technology, and guidance for who to contact for consulting about your specific project.  The Fred Hutch Genomics Shared Resource is a valuable wealth of knowledge about all types of genomic assays and are a first stop for more detailed experimental design advice and support for particular projects.
