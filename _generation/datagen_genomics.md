# Bioinformatics and Genomics Resource Library

Relevant wiki pages are linked with each subheading.
The resources section at the end of each page is a great start;
these links are placed under the most relevant heading or subheading.

Each external (e.g., non-wiki) link should include a brief explanation of why it's included, what a reader can find there, etc.

The order of subheadings can change;
it may be useful to look at how other help sites categorize types of genomic data collection.

FIXME indicates top priorities.

## Genomics

Subheadings from https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/shared-resources/core-facilities/genomics-bioinformatics/genomics-services.html,
some additional listed below "Other services" that may be included eventually (but not now).
