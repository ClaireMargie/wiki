[Quartzy](http://https://www.quartzy.com){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->) is a free, web-based lab management software. Users can organize lab member order requests, track order receipts, and organize lab inventory.  Quatrzy's ordering system integrates with the Hutch Online Marketplace, to streamline ordering. This software facilitates four main lab functions:

1. Submit supply requests -- Lab members can browse Quartzy's catalog of life science products and request supplies from their lab manager
2. Process supply requests -- Lab managers/Supply managers can receive and incoming supply requests for approval.
3. Receive and Organize lab supplies -- Users can mark supplies as received, automatically update inventory data, and alert lab members when supplies are back in stock and where to find them.
4. Search/Browse Lab inventory -- Users with appropriate permissions can search the entire contents of the lab for reagents, or browse individual locations within the lab database.
