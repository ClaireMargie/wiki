This section contains a variety of types of information about relevant
regulations and guidance for implementing studies using human subjects,
human data and/or human specimens. Given the evolving conditions and rules
surrounding studies using genetic and genomic datasets, we aim to provide an
up-to-date resource about the current state of the field relating to consenting,
privacy, and data management. However, as this field is changing rapidly, if there are changes not reflected here, please email `sciwiki` to highlight issues for additional review.  

>The Fred Hutch Policy on IRB Review of Genomic Data Sharing Policies can be found [here](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/irb/policies-and-procedures/_jcr_content/leftParsys/download_27/file.res/Review-Genomic-Data-Sharing.pdf).  This policy provides an overview of Fred Hutch requirements and pathways for submitting
for review proposals including genomic data.

## [Consenting and the IRB]({{ site.baseurl }}/generation/human_consentIRB/)

Informed consent is a cornerstone of the ethical conduct of research involving
humans. A goal of informed consent is to ensure that subjects are aware of the
risks and potential benefits of proposed research and to make an informed and
voluntary decision about participating in a research study. Unlike the risks
presented by many biomedical research protocols considered by IRBs, the risks
involved with genetic information can reach beyond the boundary of physical
injury, and also include risks of social and psychological harm. This section highlights some of the issues and resources available to address the unique issues associated with consenting and human specimen/genomics research.  

## [Data Privacy and Security]({{ site.baseurl }}/generation/human_privacySecurity/)

Every effort must be made to protect the identity of participants when human subjects, specimens or data are involved in a research project. In most
instances, sharing data should be possible without compromising the
confidentiality of participants, but if there are circumstances where data needs to
be restricted due to the inability to protect confidentiality, this should be
fully addressed in the data management and sharing plan.  This section addresses various aspects of data privacy and security including data that originates from human subjects or specimens.  

## [Compliance and Legal Agreements]({{ site.baseurl }}/generation/security_legal/)
When sharing data, there are additional issues that might arise regarding appropriate use of those data.  This section provides information about how to obtain the relevant legal agreements involved when compliance with data use restrictions is required for a project.
