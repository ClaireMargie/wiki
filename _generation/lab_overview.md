## Laboratory Covariate Management Approaches
More to come, though we intend to provide more in depth guidance for tools of particular utility to documenting, organizing and linking descriptions of laboratory based processes or experimental conditions in such a way as to provide accurate and easy linking of these data to the downstream large data sets.  The possibility of using customized REDCap projects or electronic laboratory notebook systems will be discussed.  

## The Nucleic Acid QC Omnibus:  Nucleic Acid Isolation and Analysis
A critical component of quality large scale molecular data is quality assay material, in this case, the nucleic acid itself. Multiple processes are involved in the isolation and preparation of specimens and nucleic acids upstream of data generation that can impact both what types of data are feasible to generate, as well as what types of hypotheses the data can be used to address. Different data-generating platforms are sensitive to certain types of specimen quality and quantity. While the hypothesis for a study will narrow the choices for data types required, the quality and quantity of nucleic acids from a cohort of specimens can have an even larger impact on what data types are feasible, as well as the relevance and interpretability of the resulting data sets to the intended question.  This page contains a summary of the types of nucleic acid isolation for different specimen types, the types of quality and quantity assessments and how these impact what downstream data generation process is applicable to the specimens of interest.
