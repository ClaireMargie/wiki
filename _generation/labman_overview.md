A large part of any data generation process involves the effective organization and management of specimens and lab resources.  Efficient lab management can streamline specimen receipt, processing, and any downstream data generation workflows.  This section will highlight a few useful tools for the management of physical lab resources--tools for ordering and organizing reagents, helpful equipment for common lab workflows, and where to access them at Fred Hutch.

## Support software
The organization of lab resource data is certainly not large scale data, but it can streamline lab workflows on a daily basis.  For example, having a searchable database of PCR primers and their locations in freezers and boxes can save time in the planning and execution of assays.  Alternatively, having an easily accessible communication platform among lab groups can facilitate transfer of knowledge about projects to new or existing lab members. This section will list some useful software platforms for organizing lab resources and communication.

## Shared Equipment and Wisdom
This wiki is meant to be a community resource for best practices and advice for doing large scale data generation at Fred Hutch.  Sometimes that advice is as simple as where to find a particular piece of shared equipment.  Other times it is communicating helpful techniques gained from previous specimen processing.  This section is a repository of community wisdom that comes from the lab.
