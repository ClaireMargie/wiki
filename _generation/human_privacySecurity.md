title: Data Privacy and Security
---

Every effort must be made to protect the identity of participants.  A key protective measure is to de-identify information.  Typically, this involves removing 18 key direct identifiers as described under HIPAA and indirect identifiers, such as age, gender, location, etc.  Further description of de-identification is under De-Identification of Specimens and Data.  The aim of de-identification is to maintain privacy through elimination of identifiers in a way that eliminates or greatly diminishes the risk of re-identification.  Maintaining strong data security processes is an additional key measure.  Sharing data should be done securely, after the information is de-identified and within a data management and sharing plan.  This plan should delineate data security, restrictions on data which can not be sufficiently de-identified, data use agreements, naming conventions and other clearly specified requirements.  In most instances, sharing data should be possible without compromising the confidentiality of participants.

## Preserving Patient/Participant Privacy
If you are sharing data that includes a third party’s proprietary data or has third party commercial restrictions, please call Fred Hutch Business Development and Strategy.  Where research is funded by a commercial sponsor, restrictions on data sharing may apply in arrangements agreed with the sponsor. Any such restriction(s) should be highlighted in the data management and sharing plan. In the event that you apply for or receive commercial funding for any part of research, you should advise Business Dev of the situation without delay.

### Patient Consent – Privacy Protection
All research involving 1) human subject participants; 2) patient information; or 3) tissue samples derived from patients/human participants must include appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of research participants.  You must ensure the necessary patient consent 1) adheres to Human Subjects Protection by receiving institutional IRB approval and 2) is signed by the patient prior to data sharing.  Requirements to adhere to relevant regulatory, ethical, or institutional policy should be met, data security measures established and all IRO and patient permissions should be in place prior to disclosing any data.  Requirements may dictate sharing through a data use agreement.  

### Data Use Agreement (DUA)
Data Use Agreements (DUAs) are contractual documents used for the transfer of nonpublic data that is subject to some restriction on its use.  The data provider typically originates DUAs.  Contact Fred Hutch Business Development and Strategy to initiate a DUA or review a received DUA.  DUAs serve to outline the terms and conditions of the transfer. Specifically, DUAs address important issues such as limitations on use of the data, obligations to safeguard the data, liability for harm arising from the use of the data, publication, data destruction or return and privacy rights that are associated with transfers of confidential or protected data.
  - DUAs serve to outline the terms and conditions of the transfer.

  - DUA are used most commonly for sharing data within research and/or collaboration.  DUAs are most often used when transferring data between Fred Hutch and an external entity (outside of the UW/Cancer Consortium) and may be used for transferring sensitive information between Fred Hutch and its consortium partners.  

  - DUAs typically originate with the sender.  DUAs may be specific, such as those incorporated into the context of a Clinical Trial Agreement or a sponsored research agreement, or they can be general.

  - If a Fred Hutch clinical trial is part of a multi-site trial, DUAs may be required to conduct the trial.

  - Most data sharing involves de-identified data. Less common is sharing research data with identifiable individual health information for which patient informed consent and HIPAA authorization has been approved.  Both types of data are required by Fred Hutch to have a DUA when sharing data.

  - The Privacy Rule permits sharing of a Limited Data Set. A  LDS maybe disclosed for research activities if the disclosing entity and the LDS recipient enter into a data use agreement. Limited Data Sets may be used or disclosed only for purposes of research, public health, or health care operation.

### Material Transfer Agreement (MTA)
A Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) is a contract used to govern the exchange of research data or materials between organizations. Examples include:

  cell lines, cultures, bacteria, nucleotides, proteins, transgenic animals, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals, or data cell lines, cultures, bacteria, nucleotides, proteins, transgenic animals, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals, or data software, models, robots tangible research material or raw datasets (but not databases, which are protected by copyright)

The Fred Hutch Business Development & Strategy (BDS) is responsible for negotiating and signing all MTAs with outside organizations.  Fred Hutch BDS is responsible for

  - transferring materials from Fred Hutch (as Provider) to another academic or non-profit organization as Recipient), or
  - receiving materials from another organization or company.

BDS reviews MTAs to ensure contractual obligations are consistent with Fred Hutch policy and/or federal law.  

Whether for inbound or outbound materials, MTAs are critical documents that require signatures from the Provider(s) and Recipient institution(s) to ensure that each party will comply with the terms of the agreement. Fred Hutch investigators cannot sign MTAs on behalf of the Fred Hutch.  If the MTA is embedded in a Sponsored Research Agreement, is linked to a clinical trial, or is for clinical use or clinical studies in humans, the investigator should contact Business Development and Strategy.

### Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (UBMTA)
Fred Hutch is a signatory to the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (UBMTA) Master Agreement, a contracting mechanism published by NIH on behalf of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) to facilitate the transfer of biological materials between academic institutions.  For institutions which have agreed to the terms of the UBMTA Master Agreement, it is not necessary to negotiate individualized terms for each transfer of a biological material.  Instead, an Implementing Letter is executed, which denotes the biological material as well as the providing institution and receiving institution.  The Fred Hutch scientist/investigator and a Fred Hutch institutional representative both sign the UBMTA.


## Data Sharing and Security
Generally:
  - Some federal agencies and journals have prescriptive instructions to portals or other data sharing platforms.
  - Posted online via a project or personal web site
  - Submitted as supplemental material to be hosted on a journal publisher's website
  - Deposited in an open repository or archive
  - Deposited in an open repository and publish a "data paper" describing the data
  - Emailed to individual requesters (Discouraged)
  - Use [Fred Hutch resources described at the IT Collaboration Tools site](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/collaboration-tools.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->
  - The Fred Hutch Translational Genomics Data Coordination Center (the provider of this site) is currently building a system that uses Sage Bionetwork's Synapse platform to facilitate the annotation and sharing of genomic datasets.  Email username: dharmaproject for more information.  

Fred Hutch does not currently provide a secure/encrypted exchange portal available enterprise-wide.  Typically, reciprocation should take place in an encrypted environment.  Below are various options for Fred Hutch members.
[Here,](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/collaboration-tools.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> CIT lists various options for sharing data.  Using regular Fred Hutch is highly discouraged as, generally, it is not encrypted. The standard solution for data exchange that is a little more secure than email is [Aspera.](https://aspera.fhcrc.org/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> You can use Aspera to send large amounts data through an email like interface. The recipient receives an email with a complex link URL and can then download the data. It’s a little more secure than email because you can only download the data once. If the recipient cannot get the data it likely means that security was breached and someone else got hold of that email that was sent. So you can’t prevent the breach, but at least know if one happens.

Fred Hutch data should not be stored or shared via personal applications such as DrobBox, GoogleBox. Properly licensed, corporate tools can be considered, such as Box or G-Suite with guidance from the Information Security Office.

Generally, Investigators can share their data by transferring it to a data archive facility to distribute more widely to the scientific community, to maintain documentation and meet reporting requirements. Data archives are particularly attractive for investigators concerned about managing a large volume of requests for data, vetting frivolous or inappropriate requests, or providing technical assistance for users seeking to help with analyses.

Datasets that cannot be distributed to the general public due to confidentially concerns, or third-party licensing or use agreements that prohibit redistribution, can be accessed through a data enclave. Fred Hutch does not have a data enclave and does not have a preferred recommendation for one. A data enclave provides a controlled secure environment in which eligible researchers can perform analyses using restricted data resources.
