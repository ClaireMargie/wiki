Every effort must be made to protect the privacy and confidentiality of
participants. A key protective measure is to de-identify information.
Typically, this involves removing 18 key direct identifiers as described
under HIPAA, and indirect identifiers, such as age, gender, location,
etc.

The aim of de-identification is to maintain confidentiality through
elimination of identifiers in a way that eliminates or greatly
diminishes the risk of re-identification of an individual patient (also
see our page on [de-identification]({{ site.baseurl }}/generation/human_deidentification/)). Maintaining strong
data security processes is an additional key measure. Sharing data
should be done securely, after the information is de-identified and
within a data management and sharing plan. This plan should delineate
data security, restrictions on data which cannot be sufficiently
de-identified, data use agreements, naming conventions and other clearly
specified requirements. In most instances, sharing data should be
possible without compromising the confidentiality of participants.

## Preserving Patient/Participant Confidentiality

Data/Information should be handled according to the FH Information
Classification Standard, which requires security and handling standards
commensurate with the risk of information mishandling. A copy of the Standard is located [here.](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/hdc/_jcr_content/leftParsys/download_0/file.res/Fred-Hutch-Information-Classification-and-Handling-Standard-FINAL.pdf) These standards provide guidelines for managing
data at FH and for sharing information within FH and between FH and an
outside party. Genomic data, outside of public reference data, is
considered confidential (Level II) or strictly confidential information
(Level III).

If you are sharing data that includes a third party's proprietary data
or has third-party commercial restrictions, please call Fred Hutch
Business Development & Strategy (BD&S). Where research is funded by a
commercial sponsor, restrictions on data sharing may apply because of
agreements with the sponsor. Any such restrictions should be highlighted
in the data management and sharing plan. In the event that you apply for
or receive commercial funding for any part of research, you should
advise BD&S of the situation without delay.

### Data Classification Overview
#### Public - Level I
This level includes published research results, Fred Hutch publications and communications press announcements, public record documents, job postings, open source configuration list/code/recipes, reference genomes, released data sets.

#### Confidential - Level II
This level includes preâ€“publication research information and analyses, medical expense information, invoices, legal instruments or agreements, transaction documents and reports, Fast file and Secure File server, building plans and information about the physical plant, de-identified research participant information,  and donor information.

#### Strictly Confidential - Level III
This level includes Protected Health Information (PHI), Individually Identifiable Health Information (IIHI), Personally Identifiable Information (PII), passwords and encryption keys, proprietary information including that belonging to entities other than Fred Hutch.

## Patient Consent -- Protection against Patient Harms

All research involving 1) human subject participants, 2) patient
information, or 3) tissue samples derived from patients/human
participants must include appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy
of research participants. You must ensure the necessary patient consent 
1.  adheres to Human Subjects Protection by receiving IRB approval and
2.  is signed by the patient prior to data sharing. Requirements to adhere
to relevant regulatory, ethical, or institutional policy should be met,
data security measures established and all IRO and patient permissions
should be in place prior to disclosing any data. Requirements may
dictate sharing through a data use agreement.

## Sharing Data

### Data Use Agreement (DUA)

Data Use Agreements (DUAs) are contractual documents used for the
transfer of nonpublic data that is subject to some restriction on its
use. The data provider typically originates DUAs. Contact Fred Hutch
Business Development & Strategy to initiate a DUA or review a received
DUA, using this
[questionnaire](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/business-dev/form-questionnaire.html).
DUAs serve to outline the terms and conditions of the transfer.
Specifically, DUAs address important issues such as limitations on use
of the data, obligations to safeguard the data, liability for harm
arising from the use of the data, publication, data destruction or
return and privacy rights that are associated with transfers of
confidential or protected data.

-   DUAs serve to outline the terms and conditions of the transfer.

-   DUA are used most commonly for sharing data within research and/or collaboration. DUAs are most often used when transferring data between Fred Hutch and an external entity (outside of the UW/Cancer Consortium) and may be used for transferring sensitive information between Fred Hutch and its consortium partners.

-   DUAs typically originate with the sender. DUAs may be specific, such as those incorporated into the context of a Clinical Trial Agreement or a sponsored research agreement, or they can be general.

-   If a Fred Hutch clinical trial is part of a multi-site trial, DUAs may be required to conduct the trial.

-   Most data sharing involves de-identified data. Less common is sharing research data with identifiable individual health information for which patient informed consent and HIPAA authorization has been signed. Both types of data are required by Fred Hutch to have a DUA when sharing data.

-   The Privacy Rule permits sharing of a Limited Data Set, which includes some identifiers. A LDS may be disclosed for research activities if the disclosing entity and the LDS recipient enter into a data use agreement. Limited Data Sets may be used or disclosed only for purposes of research, public health, or health care operation.

-   A sample Fred Hutch MTA can be found [here.](http://www.compass.fhcrc.org/caretweb/requests/caret%20dua%20final%20201405.pdf)  Contact Fred Hutch BD&S for more information on Fred Hutch DUAs.

### Material Transfer Agreement (MTA)

A Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) is a contract used to govern the
exchange of research data or materials between organizations. Examples
include:

> Cell lines, cultures, bacteria, nucleotides, proteins, transgenic
animals, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals, or data cell lines, cultures,
bacteria, nucleotides, proteins, transgenic animals, pharmaceuticals,
and chemicals, or data software, models, robots tangible research
material or raw datasets (but not databases, which are protected by
copyright)

The Fred Hutch Business Development & Strategy (BD&S) is responsible for
negotiating and signing all MTAs with outside organizations. Fred Hutch
BD&S is responsible for

-   transferring materials from Fred Hutch (as Provider) to another academic or non-profit organization as Recipient), or

-   receiving materials from another organization or company.

BD&S reviews MTAs to ensure contractual obligations are consistent with
Fred Hutch policy and/or federal law.

Whether for inbound or outbound materials, MTAs are critical documents
that require signatures from the Provider(s) and Recipient
institution(s) to ensure that each party will comply with the terms of
the agreement. Fred Hutch investigators cannot sign MTAs on behalf of
the Fred Hutch. If the MTA is embedded in a Sponsored Research
Agreement, is linked to a clinical trial, or is for clinical use or
clinical studies in humans, the investigator should contact Business
Development & Strategy.

### Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (UBMTA)

Fred Hutch is a signatory to the Uniform Biological Material Transfer
Agreement (UBMTA) Master Agreement, a contracting mechanism published by
NIH on behalf of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) to facilitate the
transfer of biological materials between academic institutions. For
institutions which have agreed to the terms of the UBMTA Master
Agreement, it is not necessary to negotiate individualized terms for
each transfer of a biological material. Instead, an Implementing Letter
is executed, which denotes the biological material as well as the
providing institution and receiving institution. The Fred Hutch
scientist/investigator and a Fred Hutch institutional representative
both sign the UBMTA.

## Security

Common mechanisms for sharing genomic data:

-   Hosted by portals or other data sharing platforms as prescribed by specific federal agencies or journals

-   Posted online via a project or personal website

-   Submitted as supplemental material to be hosted on a journal publisher's website

-   Deposited in an open repository or archive

-   Deposited in an open repository and publish a "data paper" describing the data

-   Emailed to individual requesters (Discouraged)

-   Shared using [Fred Hutch resources described at the IT Collaboration Tools site](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/collaboration-tools.html)

The Fred Hutch Data Classification standard addresses appropriate levels
of security. Fred Hutch does not currently provide a secure/encrypted
exchange portal available enterprise-wide. Typically, reciprocation
should take place in an encrypted environment. Below are various options
for Fred Hutch members. Using regular Fred Hutch
email is highly discouraged as, generally, it is not encrypted. Learn more about [collaborative data storage options here.](/computing/store_collaboration/)

Fred Hutch data should not be stored or shared via applications utilized for personal use. Properly licensed corporate tools or subscription applications such as DropBox, Box can be considered with guidance from the Information Security Office.

Generally, Investigators can share their data by transferring it to a
data archive facility for distribution more widely to the scientific
community, to maintain documentation and meet reporting requirements.
Data archives are particularly attractive for investigators concerned
about managing a large volume of requests for data, vetting frivolous or
inappropriate requests, or providing technical assistance for users
seeking to help with analyses.

Datasets that cannot be distributed to the general public, due to
confidentiality concerns or third-party licensing or use agreements that
prohibit redistribution, can be accessed through a data enclave. Fred
Hutch does not have a data enclave and does not have a preferred
recommendation for one. A data enclave provides a controlled secure
environment in which eligible researchers can perform analyses using
restricted data resources.
