Proteomics refers to a collection of methods used to discover and quantify the abundance and state of proteins in cells and tissue. Given that proteins are the primary drivers of cellular function, understanding which proteins are present and how they relate to one another can provide powerful insight into cell and systems biology. Likewise, analyzing proteins as biomarkers has proven useful for diagnosing disease and stratifying patients for personalized medicine.

The most basic division among proteomics experiments is the use of top-down versus bottom-up approaches. Top-down approaches, such as 2D gel electrophoresis, attempt to quantify entire proteins. In contrast, bottom approaches break proteins into small fragments, often proteolytic peptides, and algorithmically reconstruct protein identities.

A second important distinction is between "discovery" and "targeted" proteomic methods. Discovery proteomics addresses global changes in the relative abundance of multiple proteins; whereas targeted proteomics precisely quantifies a priori selected proteins or protein isoforms, e.g. phosphorylated proteins. 

## Data acquisition  
This article primarily focuses on data acquisition using mass spectrometry (MS). MS-based approaches are the most widely used in the research community and the technology is rapidly evolving.
