SciWiki content is primarily provided in a topically organized way, often users will need to consume a series of different topics in an order which allows specific work patterns to happen.  This Pathways page aims to provide a walk-through for users of the SciWiki content in order to perform specific tasks that are common to our computing community.  Each Pathway consists of a set of Pre-requisites, Glossary of terms, and a step by step series of links to portions of the SciWiki where you'll want to read more detailed information.  

>Note: These Pathways are a new and evolving resource.   If you have specific feedback on them such as additional explanations, broken links, or ideas for new Pathways you don't see, please file a GitHub issue [on our repository](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki/issues) or email your sugggestions to `scicomp`.
