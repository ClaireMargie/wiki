One of the most important first steps in your study design is to **identify the primary experimental objective**.

## Experimental objectives: Quantitative vs. Qualitative
These are the two general experimental types: qualitative (also known as investigative or annotation) and quantitative (also known as comparative).

- **Qualitative**: Generally, qualitative experiments focus on the identification or description of features in a genome, transcriptome, etc.  Examples include the identification of intron boundaries, CpG islands, or novel somatic mutations.  These experiments are typically more broad in scope, encompassing an exome, genome, methylome or transcriptome.  Here, sequencing coverage is more important than sequencing depth. If rare targets are of interest, high sequencing depth becomes more valuable.  

- **Quantitative**: Quantitative experiments are used to make statistical comparisons between two or more cohorts or experimental groups.  Examples include differential gene expression (DGE), comparison of variant allele frequencies (VAFs), or differential methylation studies.  Here, the depth of the sequencing is the experimental priority--such that sequencing depth is high enough to reveal the significant differences between targets. Biological replicates are essential in these studies to allow statistical inferences to be made among groups.

More details about study design using large scale molecular datasets is to come.
