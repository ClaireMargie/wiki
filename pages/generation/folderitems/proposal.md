## Study Design and Data Types
You could design a house without an architect, but the time and money you would spend while trying to do so are effectively wasted because there are people for whom this procedural and rote knowledge is their job.  The same is true for 'omics - there is an incredible quantity of statistics, bioinformatics and sample preparation that goes into this process. To give a study the best chance of succeeding (and being possible with the $ resources available in a suitable amount of time), identify a set of collaborators familiar with the experimental design and statistics required for a study of this kind.  

### Available Resources
- The Clinical Biostatistics Shared Resource can also help with study design and guide in what is realistic statistically.  Email FH username **biostatistics**.
- The Bioinformatics Shared Resource associated with the Fred Hutch Genomics Shared Resource is a valuable source of guidance for developing a plan for a study and with the Genomics group can provide detailed information about available platforms, estimated costs and process-specific issues to be accounted for when choosing the type of data to acquire. Email FH username **bioinformatics**.
- Translational Genomics Data Coordination Center for Data Coordination/Data Sharing Plan text for grants, including NIH standard requirement.  Email Amy at FH username **dharmaproject**.

## Proposal Materials

#### Data Sharing Plan and the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy
For extramural investigators, genomic data sharing plans are to be submitted as part of an application for funding, in the Resource Sharing Plan section of the application.

*Elements of a Genomic Data Sharing Plan*
  1.	Data Type
  2.	Data Repository
  3.	Data Submission and Release Timeline
  4.	IRB Assurance of the Genomic Data Sharing Plan
  5.	Appropriate Uses of the Data
  6.	If necessary, Request for an Exception to Submission

#### Budget and Budget Justification
More to come.

#### Facilities and Resources Descriptions
Boilerplate text for proposals that require a description of what facilities, shared resources, instruments and services are available at the Fred Hutch can be obtained in a handful of places listed below.
