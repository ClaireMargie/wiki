Before beginning a study and during the proposal preparation process, an important issue to consider is whether the research proposed qualifies as human subjects research as defined by the National Institutes of Health.  Take a look at the [NIH questionnaire to find out.](https://humansubjects.nih.gov/questionnaire){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->

## IRB Approval in Human Subjects Research
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) exist to make sure research is performed in a manner compliant with the current standards of human subjects research. IRB review of research protocol consent(s), structure, and safeguards are a critical step in genomics research.  A first step in starting a research project that may involve the generation of large scale genetic or other 'omic datasets is to ensure that the specific consents involved in the study include language specific to the possibility of generating these types of data and how those data can be used and shared.  In some cases, the use of human specimens to generate large scale molecular datasets is not considered human subjects research by the NIH and thus not subject to specific requirements associated with that type of research, even though the dataset uses human data.  For NIH grant applications submitted after January 25, 2018, a new required form allows for more clarity in addressing what the particular relationship to the human subjects is in the proposed study.  Note, if a study does not qualify as human subjects, but does use human data, an additional document describing why the study does not qualify is required in the grant application.

- If you are affiliated with the the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center or Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, a good place to start is the [Fred Hutch IRB.](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/irb.html){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->
- Similarly, if you work for the University of Washington, the [UW IRB](https://www.washington.edu/research/hsd/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> curates that information.
- If you currently have an NIH grant, are considering applying for one or are in the process of writing one, consider taking a look at [their website.](https://humansubjects.nih.gov){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->

## Retrospectively Banked Specimens and IRB Review
Depending on when the specimens were banked, the conclusions of an IRB review of the foundational collection consents signed by the patients may be different.  On January 25, 2015, NIH policy for viewing and sharing genomic data changed.  Genomic data generated from human specimens banked before this date will have different (and fewer) IRB review criteria required during the review of the consent documents associated with those specimens than for human specimens banked after this date.  Data made from human specimens banked after this date will be required to have broader sharing requirements incorporated into patient consent documents in order for any data sharing to occur while a waiver for some types of sharing requirements may be possible for specimens banked earlier for which the consent documents may be ambiguous with respect to genomic datasets.  It is important to consult with the relevant IRB if a consent with sharing requirements can limit the types of data which can be generated and if such a consent can restrict secondary usage or sharing of generated data.

## NIH Genomic Data Sharing and Informed Consent
If you are working under an NIH grant and sharing data that may fall under the NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) policy, be aware if the data you are receiving was collected under appropriate consent. The GDS Policy expects subjects who are asked to enroll in a study in which genomic data are obtained to also be asked for their informed consent to the future research use and broad sharing of their data. Only if potential subjects provide such consent would broad sharing of the data be permissible. If a subject does not consent, he or she may still be enrolled in the study, but their data may not be shared, or may be shared in a limited manner consistent with the specifics of the consent form.

In order to meet the NIH expectations under the GDS Policy, for research projects for which the IRB has granted a waiver of some or all of the required elements of informed consent under 45 CFR 46.116(d), or consent is not required because the activity is not subject to 45 CFR 46, investigators will still need to seek or document consent for future use and broad sharing of genomic and phenotypic data. At minimum, the information described below should be provided to prospective participants.

In order to meet the expectations for future research use and broad sharing under the GDS Policy, the consent should capture and convey in language understandable to prospective participants information along the following lines:
  - Genomic and phenotypic data, and any other data relevant for the study (such as exposure or disease status) will be generated and may be used for future research on any topic and shared broadly in a manner consistent with the consent and all applicable federal and state laws and regulations.

  - Prior to submitting the data to an NIH-designated data repository, data will be stripped of identifiers such as name, address, account and other identification numbers and will be de-identified by standards consistent with the Common Rule. Safeguards to protect the data according to Federal standards for information protection will be implemented.

  - Access to de-identified participant data will be controlled, unless participants explicitly consent to allow unrestricted access to and use of their data for any purpose.  Because it may be possible to re-identify de-identified genomic data, even if access to data is controlled and data security standards are met, confidentiality cannot be guaranteed, and re-identified data could potentially be used to discriminate against or stigmatize participants, their families, or groups. In addition, there may be unknown risks.

  - No direct benefits to participants are expected from any secondary research that may be conducted.

  - Participants may withdraw consent for research use of genomic or phenotypic data at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the participant is otherwise entitled. In this event, data will be withdrawn from any repository, if possible, but data already distributed for research use will not be retrieved.

  - The name and contact information of an individual who is affiliated with the institution and familiar with the research and will be available to address participant questions.

  - Studies that include whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), epigenetic profiles, microbiotic profiles, and related forms of in-depth extra-genomic data generate immense amounts of personal information about participants. It is important to draw a distinction between targeted genetic research and broader sequencing protocols, so that participants understand the scope of data generation.
