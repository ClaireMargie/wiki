Finding a collaborator to help identify if any biological feature supports or rejects your hypothesis using large scale molecular data is important because of the issues of multiple testing, determining biological significance and power issues unique to large data sets where the number of measurements (p) is much larger than the sample size (n).  The statistics required when n>>p are very different than those when p>>n and finding someone who is well versed in the specific issues that arise in this context is important.  

More to come on the following topics.  

## Reproducibility
The reproducibility of a bioinformatic or statistical analysis has been highlighted in recent years a major challenge especially in situations where the raw data are very large, private or otherwise challenging to share with reviewers of publications based on them.  Approaching a study with the intent to create a reproducible,

## Experimental Design
Issues to expand upon include assessing variability in the data generated in the cohorts of interest, the definition of a replicate, and approaches to power calculations using large scale datasets.

## Confounding and Unintended Covariates
Issues to expand upon include the types of confounding covariates that can occur when using large scale molecular data, such as batch effects of assay material isolation or genomics data creation.  Randomization of samples based on intended covariates (group A vs group B relating to the specific hypothesis the study is designed to address) as well as unintended covariates (such as sex, specimen type, date of specimen acquisition, laboratory performing the preservation or isolation, or other variables that are not associated the primary hypothesis), is critical to plan for in a study especially considering the costs to generate these data as well as the use of limited human specimens.
