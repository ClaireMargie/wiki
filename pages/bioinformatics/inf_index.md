# Bioinformatics and Analytics

This would be the landing site for the second domain, involving all things Bioinformatics and Analytics.

## Statistics and Analytics
Finding a collaborator to help identify if any biological feature supports or rejects your hypothesis using large scale molecular data is important because of the issues of multiple testing, determining biological significance and power issues unique to large data sets where the number of measurements (p) is much larger than the sample size (n).  The statistics required when n>>p are very different than those when p>>n and finding someone who is well versed in the specific issues that arise in this context is important.  

There are different groups available at the Fred Hutch who collaborate with researchers using large scale datasets and can provide valuable insight into study design, data types and hypothesis generation as well as assistance with downstream analytics.  

## Archiving and Annotating
Once large scale data sets are generated, annotating those datasets and archiving them both while using a working copy for analysis as well as retaining the archived versions until they are no longer required is a unique challenge.  The file types involved, the degrees of processing of the raw data themselves required and the overall size of the datasets can require a different approach to annotation and archiving than smaller scale research data. The following pages contain more detailed information on the relevant considerations involved in Archiving and Annotating data using available services at the Fred Hutch and with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) in mind.
