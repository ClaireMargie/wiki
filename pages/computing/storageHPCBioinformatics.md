## 1.  Data Ingestion
Whether the large scale molecular data has been generated internally at the Genomics Shared Resource or externally with a vendor or collaborator, the flow of your raw data to accessible, secure locations in an uncorrupted manner is important and will impact your downstream analyses.  Guidance for either of this scenarios is included here.

## 2.  Data Storage
Once the large scale data are made, storing them where they can be accessed and protected from corruption or inadvertent deletion is critical.  Given the current rate of expansion of the size of investigator's data, another issue relevant here is the cost of storage and preventing unnecessary or unintended data duplication, or retaining data sets that are not the raw data or currently in use.  

## 3.  High Performance Computing
There are a number of resources available at the Fred Hutch for computing processes that are performed on the raw or processed large scale data sets.  These vary in their required expertise and intended use and choosing the right approach to pre-processing and analyzing the raw data sets can have a significant impact on study success and speed.  

## 4.  Bioinformatics
From DIY to fully assisted approaches, this page discusses the basic resources available to staff involved with the bioinformatics required as part of nearly all large scale molecular data analysis processes.  From assisted work done collaboratively (via the Translational Genomics group), to support for more complex analyses or data types with the Fred Hutch Genomics Core Bioinformatics group, to completely DIY with resources provided by Scientific Computing, information about who to contact at the Fred Hutch is included.  There are emerging educational resources on this spectrum as well as multiple support/discussion type resources.
