These pages are intended to provide guidance on hiring for technical positions
in data and software at scientific institutions, such as data scientists,
programmers, and bioinformaticians. These pages draw on the personal experience
of staff and faculty in the FHCC Data Science Lab, and they are not intended to
be an authoritative or exhaustive resource. We've linked to other sources,
research, and evidence-based practices whenever possible. If you have
experience, links, or comments to add, please open a pull request or an issue on

## Getting Started

At sizeable biomedical medical and academic research institutes like Fred Hutch,
there are a wide range of roles that are being processed and supported by HR
department at any given time.  Knowing how you can best engage with the support
provided by your institution and what aspects of the process you need to take
ownership of will help you make finding and hiring into your group much more
productive.  

[Here's](https://aiden-dataminer.medium.com/data-science-interviews-50f52b9359da)
an example of a data science oriented description of the overall process of
hiring.  Much of these processes and issues are also relevant for Fred Hutch
hires.  An initial process to publicize the position, collect and review resumes
to screen applicants often happens in collaboration with your recruiting
department if your organization has one.  However, developing the approach and
process to the subsequent technical parts of the screening and hiring process
for your own group to help you screen and hire for technical data, programming,
and scientific roles will be primarily your responsibility. 

Often the process for recruiting goes generally like this:

1. Hiring manager develops the job description
    + [Writing a Job Description for a Technical Role(/datascience/tech_hiring/tech_hiring_job_description/)
2. Position is reviewed and approved for posting and publicizing
3. Candidates apply by sending requested materials to HR
4. Recruiters screen resumes for minimum qualifications and any specific
   requirements from the Hiring Manager
5. Hiring Manager reviews resumes to identify those of interest
6. Recruiters perform phone screens
7. Hiring Manager evaluates which candidates to engage their screening process
   with which might include:
    - 1:1 interview
    - Take-home code challenge
    - Live coding evaluation
    - Technical or panel interview(s)
    - On-site interview or interview rounds
8. Reference checks are performed by Hiring Manager 
9. Position is offered to candidate
10. Details are negotiated
