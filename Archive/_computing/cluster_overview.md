This section contains articles that describe a range of high performance computing resource options available to Fred Hutch researchers.


## [Linux Operating System](/computing/linux_linux101/)
The operating system for remote (non-local desktop) computing is Linux.  This page provides background on what Linux is and how you can learn to use it.

## [Technologies](/computing/resource_overview/)
This page describes all the various technologies and specifications for them that are supported by Fred Hutch for large scale computing.  

## [Scientific Software](/computing/cluster_software/)
A wide range of pre-built scientific software is available for use in large scale computing work.  This page describes how to find out what is available, how to use it and what to do if something you need is not yet available.

## [Job Management](/computing/cluster_usingSlurm/)
When doing large scale computing tasks, one often shifts to the use of jobs to perform specific tasks.  This page provides some background on managing and interacting with your tasks.  

## [Cloud Computing](/computing/cluster_cloudCompute/)
Beyond on premise resources, cloud computing access is available for Fred Hutch researchers and this page provides some basics on how to get started if you are in need of cloud computing specifically.
