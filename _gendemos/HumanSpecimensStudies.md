## Making genomic data and patient identifiers
Please provide a Fred Hutch based investigator guidance for the necessary steps involved in starting a new study that would involve prospectively banking human specimens from which they intend to generate genomic data sets that would be subject to the GDS policy but whose research staff WOULD have access to patient identifiers. Step through anything related to unique situations for funding applications (NIH focused?), Just in Time Provisional Institutional Certification, New IRB application, Data storage and sharing, GDS Certificate, public repository deposition, post-study data archiving.

## Making genomic data without knowing patient identifiers
Please provide a Fred Hutch based investigator guidance for the necessary steps involved in starting a new study using human de-identified specimens from which they intend to generate genomic data sets that would be subject to the GDS policy. Step through anything related to unique situations for funding applications (NIH focused?), Just in Time Provisional Institutional Certification, New IRB application, Data storage and sharing, GDS Certificate, public repository deposition, post-study data archiving.
