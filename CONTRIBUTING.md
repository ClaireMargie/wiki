## How to Contribute:
Steps to contribute content to the Fred Hutch Wiki Pages

*Assuming:*
People have a user account on GitHub (DIY), been added to the Fred Hutch institution on GitHub (email SciComp to do this), and been added to the AllFredHutch GitHub team (SciComp again), then to steps to contribute are as follows.

  1. Create a branch off the master branch for your edits.
  2. How should they categorize edits?
  3. Publish/push your branch to GitHub to save your work and let us know you're working on something.
  4. When done editing, create a pull request from your branch.  Suggest reviewers based on the content of the edits.
  5. Reviewers will sign off on edits by approving or providing comments on a pull request, ideally one "expert" and one "novice" based on field of expertise.  
  6. Once pull requests are merged, then any edits go live to the site [here.](https://fredhutch.github.io/wiki/)


### Other ways to contribute:
- Be an expert or novice reviewer to one of our pull requests.
- File issues for suggested new site content.
- Take 30 minutes and find as many typo's and poor grammar as you can! #my-typo-branch
