There are a variety of resources for training on various aspects of Bioinformatics and data skills available at the Fred Hutch, in the Seattle area and online.

## At FredHutch

### Courses

[fredhutch.io](http://www.fredhutch.io/) offers frequent, on campus courses on a topics such as R, python or GitHub, and information about previous and upcoming courses is on their site.  In order to sign up for courses, go to [MyHutch](https://fredhutch.okta.com/) and click on Hutch Learning to see currently available courses and register for them. fredhutch.io also helps coordinate additional events and specialized classes in collaboration with The Coop (see below).

### Community Groups

[The Coop](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/bdsc.html) (link requires login) is the Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative, and works to share information and resources about computational work across the Hutch. The Coop maintains a listserv, calendars of data science events, and The Coop Communities Slack](https://fhbig.slack.com/). [FHBig](https://fredhutch.github.io/FHBig/) is the Fred Hutch Bioinformatics Interest Group, a community-based group that hosts a [blog](https://fredhutch.github.io/FHBig/year-archive/) and facilitates information sharing among the bioinformatics research community at the Hutch. Hutch employees can learn more through the links above or by emailing `coophelp`.

The Coop and FHBig also support community groups that meet regularly to discuss topics in reproducible computational methods. To learn more about what to expect from these meetings, please visit [our Community Groups GitHub repository](https://github.com/FredHutch/community_groups). Current meeting schedules and locations are available on the [Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r?cid=Z2QzMGRsaWZyaTRmdTdoMTA0Y3VxZGowZGdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).

- **Data visualization group:**  

- **Python coding group:**

- **R coding group:**

- **Software design group:**

### Office Hours

Several groups on campus host weekly or monthly office hours to provide assistance on computational tasks. Please visit Centernet or the [Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r?cid=Z2QzMGRsaWZyaTRmdTdoMTA0Y3VxZGowZGdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) for current scheduling, locations, and contact information.

- **Bioinformatics (Shared Resources)** offers consultation on a variety of issues related to experimental design and bioinformatic analysis. They are able to answer questions on topics including: experimental design, exploring data visually (e.g., IGV, Loupe Cell Browser), generating figures for manuscripts, and developing customized workflows for unique problems. See the [Shared Resources website](http://sharedresources.fhcrc.org/core-facilities/computational-biology) for more information, and email `bioinformatics` to make sure there is time/space available during their scheduled events.
