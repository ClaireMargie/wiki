On the command line and in scripts, we use the Environment Module system to make software versions available in a modular and malleable way. Environment Modules provide modular access to one version of one or more software packages to help improve reproducibility. We use a system called EasyBuild to create modules for everyone to use - there are over a thousand modules already available. The modules listed here are the software modules available currently on `gizmo` and `beagle` compute clusters.
You can read more about how to use these modules and manage your compute environment on our [Compute Environments](/scicomputing/compute_environments/) page.
