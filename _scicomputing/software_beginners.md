## What language should I learn first?

Should I learn R or Python?

It's like asking, "Should I learn Spanish or Italian?"

Are you going to Spain or Italy?
Once you learn one, the other is easier

Choose the tool that best fits your needs

Considerations:
What are other people in your immediate work group using?
What tools are most commonly used in your field? Talking with other people, manuscripts, availability of code on GitHub, etc
Personal preference
Where do you want to end up?

It's important to be deliberate in your choice of first language to learn, but it's not committing you to only using that language in the future
