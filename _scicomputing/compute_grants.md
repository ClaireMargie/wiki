## Amazon Web Services 

Amazon offers the [AWS Cloud Credits for Research](https://aws.amazon.com/grants/) program, where you can apply for a grant to get AWS Credits that you can use on AWS Services.  For the *AWS Account Number* field in the application, please contact SciComp and we will give you the correct number to use in your grant application.  If you receive credits from AWS, you will need to contact SciComp to request an account in the Sandbox environment.
