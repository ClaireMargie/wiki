## [Training and Finding Help](/scicomputing/reference_training/)

There are many opportunities for training (courses and tutorials) and connecting with coding communities. The Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative (The Coop) and fredhutch.io offer events and meeting groups. Additional opportunities are available elsewhere in Seattle (at UW and through Meetup.com) and online.

## [For Beginners: How to Start Learning to Code](/scicomputing/reference_beginners/)

This FAQ-style page includes answers to questions like "How do I get started learning to code?" and "What language should I learn first?"

## [Resource library](/compdemos/)

The Resource Library contains both links to GitHub repositories containing templates for coding projects and example code, as well as tutorials and demonstrations for accomplishing tasks with Hutch data science resources.

## [Announcements](/scicompannounce)

Scientific Computing sends email updates to their list of users about changes to software and hardware. Important announcements are also archived here.
