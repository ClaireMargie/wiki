The rest of this wiki provides general guidelines and approaches to working with data at Fred Hutch. This reference section includes information on where to obtain training, as well as specific step-by-step tutorials for accomplishing tasks with Hutch resources.

## [Training and Finding Help](/scicomputing/reference_training/)

There are many opportunities for training (courses and tutorials) and connecting with coding communities. The Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative (The Coop) and fredhutch.io offer events and meeting groups. Additional opportunities are available elsewhere in Seattle (at UW and through Meetup.com) and online.

## [For Beginners: How to Start Learning to Code](/scicomputing/reference_beginners/)

This FAQ-style page includes answers to questions like "How do I get started learning to code?" and "What language should I learn first?"

## [Resource library](/compdemos/)

The Resource Library contains tutorials and demonstrations for accomplishing common computing tasks using Hutch data science resources. Also see [Code Example and Templates](/scicomputing/software_examples/), which focuses on larger-scale code projects.

## [Information for Grant Writers](/scicomputing/compute_grants/)

This section includes boilerplate language about resources for research computing that is appropriate for inclusion in grant proposals.

## [Announcements](/scicompannounce/)

Scientific Computing sends email updates to their list of users about changes to software and hardware. Important announcements are also archived here.
