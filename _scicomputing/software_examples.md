Our [Resource Library](/compdemos/) includes tutorials of how to perform common computational tasks using software available at Fred Hutch. If you're interested in implementing these methods on your own data following best practices for reproducibility, the resources below include templates for setting up your own analyses, as well as additional examples of executable code that can be tailored to suit your own needs.

These templates and examples are generally published as GitHub repositories. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, please see our section on [Managing and Sharing Code]. If you have other templates or examples you would like to see posted here, please file an [issue in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki/issues) or read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki#contributing-to-sciwiki) to learn how you can add the content yourself.

## Templates for data analysis and coding

The following repositories were created by researchers at Fred Hutch to assist in software development and data analysis following best practices for reproducibility.

- [Python data analysis template](https://github.com/FredHutch/python-analysis-template): Data analysis project using Python in Jupyter notebooks
- [Python tool development template](https://github.com/FredHutch/python-tool-template): Developing a Python package
- [Flask Python template](https://github.com/FredHutch/flask-python-template): Creating a web application using Python
- [Shiny app template](https://github.com/FredHutch/shiny-app-template): template for creating an interactive web application using the R package Shiny
- [SCHARP templates](https://github.com/FredHutch/scharpTemplates): templates used by the Fred Hutch research group [SCHARP](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division/research/biostatistics-bioinformatics-and-epidemiology/statistical-center-for-hiv-aids-research-and-prevention/about.html0) for data analysis in R

Other groups have developed templates for more general use:

- [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) is a command-line utility that allows you to create projects from project templates that includes a wide variety of functionality for different languages.
- [Shablona](https://github.com/uwescience/shablona) is a template developed by UW's eScience that is specifically designed for small scientific Python projects.
