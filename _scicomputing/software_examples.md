There are a variety of creators around FRed Hutch and beyond who have provided code examples or templates beyond what is described in our [Resource Library](/compdemos/).  These include resources like template GitHub repositories (learn more about using those [here](/scicomputing/software_managecode/)) you can clone and use directly, to examples of code that users have used to perform tasks on Fred Hutch infrastructure that you can copy and tailor to your own use.  If you know of other resources the community might benefit from that are not linked to here, please file an [issue in our GitHub repo](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki/issues) with the link and some context about it (what is it? why should people be interested in it?).  Or if you would like to contribute either a [Resource Library](/compdemos/) entry or link your own template/example repo, you can also file an [issue in our GitHub repo](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki/issues) or [add it yourself](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki)!!
