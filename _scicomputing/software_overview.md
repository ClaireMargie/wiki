Frequently in scientific research, we must write code in order to perform our desired analysis. Whether we are writing a short script for our own manuscript, or making an app we intend to share with other researchers, incorporating standard programming practices will enhance the readability and reproducibility of our work. Below, we provide an overview of Fred Hutch coding standards as well as resource pages for commonly used programming languages in biosciences research.

## [Getting Started with Common Languages](/scicomputing/software_languages/)

Fred Hutch has several resources available for folks that are seeking instruction in a new programming language, version control (managing and sharing code), or navigating linux/shell scripting. If software development in research is new to you, or you wish to pick up a new skill, we recommend you start with the [Common Languages](/scicomputing/software_languages/) page.

The remainder of this section will presume a basic skill level in at least one common language, as well as a basic understanding of [GitHub](/scicomputing/software_managecode/).


## [Where to run code](/scicomputing/software_running/)

You have the option to run code on a local (desktop) computer, or on a shared computing cluster. This section helps you figure out what will work best for your task.


## [Wiki Examples Repository](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki-code-examples)

In addition to the documentation provided in this wiki, we maintain a repository of coding examples to demonstrate the use of our coding standards, while showcasing some features and packages that could be useful in your research. We aim to include projects of various scope, so we can exhibit the software development principals in different types of user interfaces (e.g.: packages and interactive notebooks will both be included with appropriate documentation).

We encourage a broad range of coding example submissions from researchers, with the hope that it will enhance innovation and learning within Fred Hutch. The submission requirements are outlined in the following section, [Fred Hutch Software Development Standards](#fred-hutch-software-development-standards). In addition to creating reference material for your peers and gaining local notoriety as an awesome developer/researcher, you will have the added benefit of additional technical review and sharing/communicating your work with other researchers that may be interested in follow up.

>Note: A common use of the examples repository will be to clone a copy locally and play with the available code. For this reason, we ask that data files not be stored in the repository.


### Accessing the Examples

Examples can be explored in a web browser by clicking the link above. Alternatively, you can use github to clone a copy to your local machine, where you can modify and play with the example code independently.

```
git clone https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki-code-examples.git
```

For more information on using Github, see the [Managing and Sharing Code](/scicomputing/software_managecode/) page in this wiki.


### Submitting Your Code
When you have completed a coding project that you would like to submit to the examples wiki, there are a few steps in Github to navigate the review process. In order to submit to the repo, you will need to join the Fred Hutch GitHub organization by sending your GitHub username to `helpdesk` with a request to be added. For additional resources on using GitHub at Fred Hutch, see our [Wiki page on the topic](/scicomputing/software_managecode/).

## [Fred Hutch Software Development Standards](/scicomputing/software_standards/)

This linked section documents coding standards at Fred Hutch, along with several helpful tool suggestions and examples. In an effort to create high-quality, transparent, and reproducible software-aided research, it is important that best software practices be fused into the process.
