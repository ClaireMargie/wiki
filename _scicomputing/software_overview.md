Frequently in scientific research, we must write code in order to perform our desired analysis. Whether we are writing a short script for our own manuscript, or making an app we intend to share with other researchers, incorporating standard programming practices will enhance the readability and reproducibility of our work. Below, we provide an overview of what coding languages are commonly used at the Hutch, different resources for running code, and recommendations for developing research software.  

## [Getting Started with Common Languages](/scicomputing/software_languages/)

If you are new to coding, or are interested in learning about coding languages for research software, we recommend you start with the [Common Languages](/scicomputing/software_languages/) page.

The remainder of the Software Development content will presume a basic skill level in at least one common language, as well as a basic understanding of [GitHub](/scicomputing/software_managecode/) for version control.

## [Where to run code](/scicomputing/software_running/)

You have the option to run code on a local (desktop) computer, or on a shared computing cluster. This section helps you figure out what will work best for your task.

## [Software Development Standards](/scicomputing/software_standards/)

In an effort to create high-quality, transparent, and reproducible software-aided research, it is important that best practices be fused into the process of code development. This section documents coding standards for research software, templates for different types of coding projects, and examples coding projects.
