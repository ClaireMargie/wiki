Welcome to the Hutch- here are a few resources to help with your computational needs:

## Online Communities

This Slack channel is a place for Hutch researchers to ask questions, get updates, and build community.  Only your at-fredhutch.org email address is required (no invitation necessary)

[fhData](https://fhdata.slack.com)

## Support Organizations and Where to Find Them

These groups can help you identify and use compute resources at the Hutch

Fred Hutch's [Data Science Lab (DaSL)](https://hutchdatascience.org/)
[Scientific Computing (SciComp)](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/scicomp.html)
[Service Desk](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/center-it/help-desk.html)

## Events and Meetings

Got questions on managing, using, and analysing data?  [Data Housecalls](https://hutchdatascience.org/datahousecalls/) may be for you!  Schedule some time with the Data Science team.
[Effective Computing](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a7128526d3409428c969260d7dcce2f6b%40thread.skype/Effective%2520Computing%2520Drop%2520In?groupId=1b968d63-dc19-460f-9e6d-cdbd539d1bc6&tenantId=0054a3ea-b394-418b-ad1a-174138231fd6) is a drop-in time where DaSL and Scientific Computing team members are available to help you effectively use the computational and data resources at the Hutch
[SciComp Office hours](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3abe85aa58c3624fb79c1590342ec75c63%40thread.skype/DaSL%2520Data%2520House%2520Calls?groupId=1b968d63-dc19-460f-9e6d-cdbd539d1bc6&tenantId=0054a3ea-b394-418b-ad1a-174138231fd6) is a drop-in Teams meeting where Scientific Computing is available to help with your research computing needs.

## Documentation

The [SciWiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org) is a community maintained wiki that with documentation on:
 - using compute resources and computational tools
 - generating and analysing data
 

## Training Resources

The [cluster 101](https://hutchdatascience.org/training/#cluster-101) training course is good for those new to cluster computing as well as those new to the Hutch's computing infrastructure.
The [pathways](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/pathways/) section of the wiki contains step-by-step instructions on specific tasks
