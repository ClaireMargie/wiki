While version control software has evolved over time, a new evolution that is happening more and more is the need for a wider group of researchers to actively use version control resources to manage their code and documentation of processes that are ongoing in their research.  From the perspective of reproducibility, shareability and interoperability, the need for a sharing platform that integrates version control and collaboration is becoming more and more a critical part of a researcher's toolkit.  Thus, regardless of the degree to which code plays a direct role in a research project, more and more often at least a cursory understanding of what GitHub is and how it can be utilized in scientific research is important.  

## What is Github?
GitHub at it's core is a Git repository hosting service.  While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface as well as access control and several collaboration features, such as wiki's and basic task management tools for projects.  GitHub is a free service that individuals can make their own usernames to join the service and begin hosting publicly accessible repositories containing code they have produced or edited.  As GitHub was originally intended to facilitate open source software development, the basic resources available to users are only public, but free, repositories in order to continue to encourage developers to keep their code in the open and shared.  There are a wide variety of ever-changing features that GitHub provides that facilitates code sharing, communication, version control, project management, and software development tools such as facilitating software release and documentation.  

### Command Line Git

### GitHub Desktop Client
For many users, command line git is not the ideal mode of interacting with version control software.  As an example, if the majority of the code produced by a user is originating from interfaces such as RStudio, it may be much simpler and more straightforward to use GitHub via the desktop client.  You can download the desktop client for your system for free [here.](https://desktop.github.com/)

The desktop client will allow you to "clone" repositories from the web based GitHub source and allow you to work on those files locally.  Then when edits have been made to files in those repositories, those edits will be shown in the GitHub Desktop client for the user to then comment on and commit those changes to the version of the repository on the web.

There are many different ways of working with multiple people on multiple files in a GitHub repository, and there are many places on the web that can provide some insight into how to use it's many features.  However, [this GitHub Guide for the flow of using GitHub is useful for understanding the basics.](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

## Sharing with GitHub
Given the history of GitHub being linked with open source software development, it is set up with the intention to prioritize publicly accessible code.   However, given the need to limit access to code under development and not ready for public input, or other situations such as in the context of biomedical research, private repositories are available.  

### Public vs Private Repositories
When creating a repository the user chooses whether it should be public or private.  Private repositories require payment, but GitHub provides unlimited, free public repositories.  

### Individual vs Institution GitHub Repositories
When the software is being developed as part of an institution, such as at Fred Hutch, users can use repositories that are their individual repositories OR their username can be associated with an institution.  The Fred Hutch supports the use of GitHub for research via this institutional account which allows all Fred Hutch employees to create public *or* private repositories.  This wiki itself is developed and managed via a Fred Hutch institution [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/FredHutch/wiki)  This resource is a valuable tool for researchers looking to manage, communicate and document code or analysis processes in a platform that can be both private or public, and where they can manage permissions to their repositories.
