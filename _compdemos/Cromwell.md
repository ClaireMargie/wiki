This page will house our Fred Hutch knowledge-base for setting up and using the [Cromwell workflow manager](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) from the Broad as well as useful tidbits and links regarding WDL based workflows.  

For now, relevant GitHub resources for setting up and running your own Cromwell server on our local cluster can be found in the [DIY-cromwell-server repo](https://github.com/FredHutch/diy-cromwell-server) and the associated R package called [fh.wdlR](https://github.com/FredHutch/fh.wdlR) should you want to interact with your server primarily from your desktop R/RStudio.  


More to come!  Contact Amy Paguirigan (`apaguiri`) for more information about using Cromwell at Fred Hutch.  Join the discussion in The Coop Slack in the [#cromwell-wdl channel](https://fhbig.slack.com/archives/CTFU13URJ).
