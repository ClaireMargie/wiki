This page will house our Fred Hutch knowledge-base for setting up and using the [Cromwell workflow manager](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) from the Broad as well as useful tidbits and links regarding WDL based workflows. If you have questions about what Cromwell is, how it might help you or to get started, feel free to email Amy Paguirigan (Senior Staff Scientist in CRD), `apaguiri`.  

For now, relevant GitHub resources for setting up and running your own Cromwell server on our local cluster can be found in the [DIY-cromwell-server repo](https://github.com/FredHutch/diy-cromwell-server) and the associated R package called [fh.wdlR](https://github.com/FredHutch/fh.wdlR) should you want to interact with your server primarily from your desktop R/RStudio.  The [readme](https://github.com/FredHutch/diy-cromwell-server) in the DIY repo is currently the most up to date set of instructions for setting up Cromwell at the Fred Hutch. 

Other public repositories containing WDL or Cromwell related content at the Fred Hutch can be found [via this link](https://github.com/FredHutch?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=wdl+OR+cromwell&type=&language=) and also the [Workflow Manager Project](https://github.com/orgs/FredHutch/projects/8) is a resource that is intended to be a collection of links for either of the two Fred Hutch workflow managers.  

Beyond the two basic workflows for testing included in the [DIY-cromwell-server repo](https://github.com/FredHutch/diy-cromwell-server), there is an example [unpaired variant calling workflow](https://github.com/FredHutch/tg-wdl-unpairedVariantCaller) that can be run by Fred Hutch users on campus that has example data linked vis the inputs json file. 


More to come!  Contact Amy Paguirigan (`apaguiri`) for more information about using Cromwell at Fred Hutch.  Join the discussion in The Coop Slack in the [#cromwell-wdl channel](https://fhbig.slack.com/archives/CTFU13URJ).
